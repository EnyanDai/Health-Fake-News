A social media meme exacerbated the anxiety with the claim that Italian doctors had \u201cdecided NOT to treat the elderly,\u201d and that that was the result of \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d\nAs of mid-March, Italy was the hardest-hit nation outside of Asia and had become the new epicenter for the global pandemic. As in China, where the virus was initially detected in the winter of 2019, the Italian health care system was overwhelmed by the disease. Amid fears that the United States could end up in a similar situation, a viral Facebook meme pointed the finger at Italy\u2019s government-run health care system.The meme appears to represent both an exaggeration and distortion of news reports and events in Italy regarding the coronavirus. Readers also inquired about an article published by the British news publication The Telegraph, headlined, \u201cItalians over 80 \u2018will be left to die\u2019 as country overwhelmed by coronavirus.\u201d The article references a document drawn up by health officials in Turin, a city in Northern Italy hit hard by the virus, with guidelines for if and when \u201cIt becomes impossible to provide all patients with intensive care service.\u201d In such a case, the document says, \u201cIt will be necessary to apply criteria for access to intensive treatment, which depends on the limited resources available.\u201d\nThe Telegraph reported that the document \u201cproduced by the civil protection department of the Piedmont region, one of those hardest hit, says: \u2018The criteria for access to intensive therapy in cases of emergency must include age of less than 80 or a score on the Charlson comorbidity Index [which indicates how many other medical conditions the patient has] of less than 5.'\u201d\nThe guidelines were expected to affect the whole country and go into effect, according to the Telegraph, \u201c\u2018If the situation becomes of such an exceptional nature as to make the therapeutic choices on the individual case dependent on the availability of resources, forcing [hospitals] to focus on those cases in which the cost/benefit ratio is more favorable for clinical treatment.'\u201d\nIn other words, it is not true that Italy as a whole had \u201cdecided not to treat their elderly\u201d for the coronavirus. What is true per news reports is that overwhelmed Italian health systems that have more patients than available equipment could face \u201ccatastrophe\u201d triage decisions not seen since World War II. That has nothing to do the fact that Italy, like other European countries, has a public health care system, or what some people call \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d It is instead the result of the sheer volume of cases flooding the hospitals.\nAs of March 12, 2020, The New York Times reported that Italian officials had maintained that everyone who needed care was entitled to it. In a public statement on the matter, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte stated, \u201cWe live in a system in which we guarantee health and the right of everyone to be cured. It\u2019s a foundation, a pillar, and I\u2019d say a characteristic of our system of civilization. And thus we can\u2019t allow ourselves to let our guard down.\u201d\nThe Times also reported that Flavia Petrini, president of the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care, had issued \u201ccatastrophe medicine\u201d guidelines:\n\u201cIn a context of grave shortage of health resources,\u201d the guidelines say, intensive care should be given to \u201cpatients with the best chance of success\u201d and those with the \u201cbest hope of life\u201d should be prioritized.\nThe guidelines also say that in \u201cin the interests of maximizing benefits for the largest number,\u201d limits could be put on intensive care units to reserve scarce resources to those who have, first, \u201cgreater likelihood of survival and secondly who have more potential years of life.\u201d\n\u201cNo one is getting kicked out, but we\u2019re offering criteria of priority,\u201d Dr. Petrini said. \u201cThese choices are made in normal times, but what\u2019s not normal is when you have to assist 600 people all at once.\u201d\nGiulio Gallera, the Lombardy official leading the emergency response, said on Thursday that he hoped the guidelines never needed to be applied.\nIn sum, Italy did not announce it would abandon elderly patients with COVID-19 wholesale. Instead, health care workers in various circumstances and locales might be forced to ration treatment and make judgments based on who is expected to live longest, if treated. Chinese doctors have faced this situation, and some fear it may be in store for the U.S. health care system if the number of active coronavirus cases in the United States isn\u2019t successfully controlled. We therefore rate this claim a \u201cMixture\u201d of true and false.", "links": ["https://fortune.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-cases-china-hospitals-turn-away-patients/", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/14/italians-80-will-left-die-country-overwhelmed-coronavirus/?li_source=LI&li_medium=liftignit", "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/12italy-coronavirus-health-care.html", "http://www.governo.it/it/media/dichiarazioni-alla-stampa-del-presidente-conte/14274", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/15/coronavirus-rationing-us/"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/03/meme.jpg"]}
