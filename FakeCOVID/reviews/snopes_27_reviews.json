While the AB-TC website does not carry any disclaimers labeling its content as fiction, we found a number of red flags concerning the legitimacy of this outlet\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nFor starters, this website is full of junk news stories. For instance, a July 2010 article (still featured on the homepage) carries the headline, \u201cBREAKING: New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur has died.\u201d But Shurmur didn\u2019t die in 2010. In fact, he is still alive as of this writing and was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos in January 2020.\nThe website has also published hoax articles about \u201ccannibal restaurants\u201d (debunked here), death hoaxes about celebrity couples (debunked here), doctored tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, and a junk news article that falsely claimed Prince Andrew had committed suicide.\nThis website has also previously spread misinformation about the coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The government of Singapore released a statement on Jan. 30, 2020, to refute claims published in an AB-TC report:\nCorrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods published by AB-TC City News\u2019 website\nOn 30 Jan 2020, a website called \u2018City News\u2019 published an article titled \u201cBREAKING NEWS: Singapore records six more coronavirus case, total of 16 now\u201d (https://ab-tc.com/singapore-coronavirus-cases/) claiming that five Singaporeans have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus without going to China.\nAs of 9pm on 30 Jan 2020, there is no local transmission of the Wuhan virus in Singapore. All confirmed cases in Singapore to date are Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan.\nNone of the AB-TC articles we examined was accompanied by a person\u2019s byline. Rather, they were all written by so-called \u201clocal correspondents.\u201d\u00a0\nIn other words, this website doesn\u2019t exactly have a great track record of genuine news reporting.\u00a0\nIn addition to its history of pushing misinformation, there are also a few red flags in AB-TC\u2019s article about the mass killing of coronavirus patients. For instance, like most of the other articles on this website, this article contains no links back to supporting evidence. Even when the article mentions secondary sources, such as a \u201cdocument\u201d or a \u201cpress conference,\u201d they provide no evidence to show that these items actually exist or took place. The article is also suspiciously void of specifics. AB-TC reports that \u201cthe state\u201d or \u201cthe court\u201d or an \u201cofficial\u201d made a statement, but doesn\u2019t provide any direct quotes or names in its report.\u00a0\nLastly, no credible news outlets have published reports containing this claim. The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, 2020, that a senior official in China \u201cordered the authorities in the city of Wuhan to immediately round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.\u201d That report, of course, made no mention of \u201cmass killings.\u201d\nThere is also no mention of this supposed court case on the The Supreme People\u2019s Court of the People\u2019s Republic of China website.\u00a0\u00a0\nAB-TC is the sole source of this rumor. However, this website provided no evidence to support its claim. This website also has a history of spreading misinformation. As this claim is not supported by any other credible news reports, we\u2019ve concluded that this report is indeed false.\u00a0", "links": ["http://archive.ph/4bUue", "http://archive.ph/d1rJ8", "https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/broncos-name-pat-shurmur-as-offensive-coordinator", "http://archive.ph/esEB7", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nightclub-patrons-meat/", "http://archive.ph/AmxQG", "https://hoax-alert.leadstories.com/3470655-fake-news-breaking-news-shaunae-miller-and-husband-maicel-uibo-drown-in-canada-while-fishing---lates.html", "http://archive.ph/F03L8", "http://archive.ph/2wo9p", "https://www.gov.sg/article/factually-clarifications-on-falsehoods-posted-by-abtc-city-news", "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html#link-3cb0be85", "http://english.court.gov.cn/index.html"], "imgs": []}
