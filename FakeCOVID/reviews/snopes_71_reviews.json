While the humorous nature of the post seemed rather obvious, search queries from people concerned with Eminem\u2019s health quickly registered here at Snopes.\u00a0\nEminem did not contract coronavirus. This silly piece of text is just a joke that repurposed some of Eminem\u2019s lyrics. We\u2019re not entirely sure where this joke originated because the text was copy and pasted across different social media posts.\nHere\u2019s how this joke appeared on the \u201cDad Jokes\u201d section of Reddit:\n\u201cIn a statement released by doctors, it has been revealed that his palms were sweaty, knees weak and arms were heavy.. He presented with vomit on his sweater already.. Initial testing has revealed it was mums spaghetti\u201d\nIf this \u201cnews\u201d story sounds a bit familiar, it\u2019s because the text borrows heavily from Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d The song, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, starts with the lyrics:\n\u201cHis palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere\u2019s vomit on his sweater already, mom\u2019s spaghetti\u201d\nHere\u2019s a video of the song from the movie \u201c8 Mile\u201d:\nThis is hardly the first piece of misinformation to spread about the coronavirus. We\u2019ve previously debunked claims about \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d predicting the outbreak, a pamphlet warning about the disease spreading via sex with animals, and China seeking approval to kill 20,000 patients to stop the spread of the disease. All of these claims were false.\nOf course, the 2020 outbreak of coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, was no joke. As of this writing, more than 30,000 people worldwide were reported to have been infected and more than 600 had died as a result in China.
