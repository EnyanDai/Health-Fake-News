The staff at the facility told the teen to try the emergency room at the local public hospital, Antelope Valley (AV) Hospital,\u201d but the boy died while in transit to the hospital. The Antelope Valley is a community about 45 miles north of the city of Los Angeles.\nThe claim that the boy was denied medical care for COVID-19 symptoms due to a lack of health coverage originated with comments from Rex Parris, the mayor of the Antelope Valley city of Lancaster, in a video uploaded to the city\u2019s YouTube page. In the video, Parris said the boy had gone to an urgent-care facility for an HMO (health maintenance organization). \u201cHe didn\u2019t have insurance, so they did not treat him, and sent him to A.V. (Antelope Valley) Hospital.\u201d The boy went into cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital, Parris said in the video.\nAfter the story went viral, however, Parris clarified his comments in a Facebook post. In that March 29, 2020, post, Parris referred to the boy only as \u201cWilliam\u201d and noted he was the only person to die of the illness in the city as of that writing.\n\u201cWe have learned more information about William\u2019s death,\u201d Parris wrote. \u201cHis family did have health insurance. When the family called his HMO, they were (correctly) told to take him to the emergency room. There was some initial confusion, possibly from language difficulties about the status of health insurance, but the family always had insurance. His family did everything possible to protect William, but this disease is fast and deadly.\u201d\nHe reiterated much the same in an April 2 interview with Time Magazine. We reached out to Parris by email and have not yet received a response.", "links": ["https://gizmodo.com/teen-who-died-of-covid-19-was-denied-treatment-because-1842520539?utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_twitter&utm_source=gizmodo_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkhnAF7E5xw&feature=youtu.be", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2925741084135736&set=a.123691534340719&type=3&theater", "https://time.com/5813731/teen-denied-insurance-coronavirus/"], "imgs": []}
