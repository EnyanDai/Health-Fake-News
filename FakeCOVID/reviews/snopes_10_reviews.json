Testing by Washington State Health department confirmed the COVID-19 virus particles were present in the samples they took from five separate packages of toilet paper from Big Box stores. The CDC said this strain of deadly virus \u201cbreeds rapidly in tissue fibers.\u201d\nThe CDC is urging people to using a wet washcloth when cleaning themselves after using the bathroom instead of toilet paper.\nThis is not a genuine news article. Now8News is a junk news site that traffics in misinformation.\u00a0\nNow8News does not carry a readily available disclaimer labeling its content as \u201csatire\u201d or \u201cfake news,\u201d but this website\u2019s content is undoubtedly fiction. We\u2019ve been debunking misinformation from Now8News since at least 2015, including junk news articles about people having sex with pigs at Walmart, a cannibal eating a person at a haunted house in Texas, and a lottery winner who died after dipping his testicles in gold.\u00a0\u00a0\nThose unfamiliar with this site, however, were given no indications that this toilet-paper story was false. It was presented like a traditional news story and even includes fabricated quotes from the CDC.\u00a0\nNow 8 News writes:\nThe CDC is urging people to using a wet washcloth when cleaning themselves after using the bathroom instead of toilet paper.\n\u201cUse a washcloth to clean yourself after you go to the bathroom, it\u2019s not a big deal, that\u2019s what we did back in the old days,\u201d said Peter Lendl, who headed the investigation of the contaminated toilet paper. \u201cJust know which one is yours.\u201d\nThis is not a genuine quote from the CDC. We were unable to find this quote in news articles, social media posts from someone named \u201cPeter Lendl,\u201d or from a CDC press release. In fact, the only results for this quote pointed back to this junk news article from Now8News.\u00a0\nIn sum, the CDC did not announce in March 2020 that the new strain of coronavirus was \u201crapidly breeding\u201d on toilet paper and that people should use a wet washcloth instead. You can find genuine information about how to deal with the coronavirus on the CDC website.\u00a0", "links": ["http://archive.vn/piH1g", "https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html"], "imgs": []}
