Other than the name, his fictional biological weapon had little in common with the virus that caused a real outbreak in 2020.", "content": "When readers first came across a biological weapon named \u201cWuhan-400\u201d in Dean Koontz\u2019s novel \u201cThe Eyes of Darkness,\u201d we doubt anyone had the notion that the famous thriller author was \u201cpredicting\u201d a real-world outbreak of COVID-19, coronavirus disease. But in February 2020, after such an outbreak had occurred, eagle-eyed Koontz fans shared this passage as if the famous thriller author was a prognosticator.\u00a0\n\nThis is a genuine page from the novel \u201cThe Eyes of Darkness.\u201d The passage can be seen in Amazon\u2019s preview of a mass market paperback edition of this novel that was released in December 2008.\nIt\u2019s true that Koontz named a fictional biological weapon \u201cWuhan-400\u201d in this novel. It\u2019s also true that Wuhan, China, is the city at the center of the 2020 coronavirus outbreak. However, that\u2019s pretty much where the similarities end.\u00a0\nHere are a few things this \u201cprediction\u201d gets wrong:\nBut there\u2019s more bad news for this prediction.\u00a0\nWhile the page from Koontz\u2019s novel displayed above is genuine, other iterations of this book used a different name for the fictional biological weapon. In fact, when we searched a 1981 edition of this book available via Google Books we found no references to \u201cWuhan.\u201d In that edition, this biological weapon is called \u201cGorki-400\u201d after the Russian city where it was created.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re not entirely sure when or why this change occurred. From what we can tell, the biological weapon was originally called \u201cGorki-400\u201d when this book was published in 1981. But by 2008, the name had been changed to \u201cWuhan-400.\u201d\nRegardless of when \u201cWuhan-400\u201d made its way into Koontz\u2019 novel, this is not a prediction. Koontz did not claim that the events that took place in his novel would later come to fruition, and the similarities between \u201cWuhan-400\u201d and COVID-19 are minimal. Furthermore, readers only noticed this \u201cprediction\u201d\u00a0after\u00a0an outbreak of coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China, which makes this \u201cprediction\u201d nothing more than a coincidence.\u00a0\nAnother image supposedly showing a second page from Koontz\u2019 novel \u201cThe Eyes of Darkness\u201d was also circulated on social medias as further evidence that the author had \u201cpredicted\u201d the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nThis page does not come from Koontz\u2019 novel \u201cThe Eyes of Darkness.\u201d This actually comes from a book called \u201cEnd of Days\u201d by self-described psychic Sylvia Browne.
