We\u2019ve examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \u201cbioweapon\u201d conspiracy theory here.)\u00a0An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\u00a0\n5G was already a \u201cboogeyman\u201d in the conspiracy theory community. We\u2019ve previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \u201cevidence\u201d supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re related (correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation).\u00a0\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren\u2019t cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \u201csmart\u201d lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere\u2019s the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several \u2018smart\u2019 lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.\u00a0", "links": ["http://archive.vn/MzYv9", "https://www.instagram.com/p/B-cqZkuj-zV/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading", "https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/04/01/covid-19-bioweapon/", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hazmat-suits-5g-equipment/", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/japan-5g-ban/", "http://archive.vn/yzI6H", "https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/01/the-u-s-now-has-4-live-5g-networks-but-good-luck-actually-using-them/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-telecoms-5g/who-was-first-to-launch-5g-depends-who-you-ask-idUSKCN1RH1V1", "https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-first-5g-network-launched-by-deutsche-telekom/a-49467131", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsummary.html#emergence"], "imgs": []}
