If you are home , go on Netflix now \u2026\u2026. Type \u201cMy Secret Terrius\u201d and go to season -1 and episode 10 and move straight to 53 minutes point ! (P.S. this season was made in 2018 and we are in 2020) . This is shocking \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 was it a plan ?? pic.twitter.com/KqTZwA1IO2\n\u2014 Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh) March 26, 2020\n\nThis is a real scene from a 2018 show. But while many people may have only heard the word \u201ccoronavirus\u201d for the first time in 2020, it has been around for decades.\nScientists first identified human coronaviruses in humans in the 1960s. Since then, we\u2019ve seen a few coronavirus outbreaks, such as the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2012 and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2002. In a longer version of this clip, the TV doctor explains how these diseases all come from the same group of viruses:\nIn the drama My Secret Terrius that was released in 2018 (UNIQ's sungjoo was among the cast) they talked in details about the corona virus\u2026. I had goosebumps\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nuQ3UYZlMR\n\u2014 \uc544\ub9ac\ud83e\udd84 (@eoeoes) March 18, 2020\n\nThe fictional coronavirus in the show is also rather different from the strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that was spreading around the globe in early 2020. In the show, someone \u201ctweaked\u201d the virus in order to make it more deadly. In reality, that simply isn\u2019t possible. COVID-19 is not a human-made bioweapon. (You can read about that conspiracy theory\u2019s origins and scientific failings here.)\nThe coronavirus in the show also has a 90% mortality rate. While we still have a lot to learn about COVID-19, the disease does not have a 90% mortality rate. The case fatality rate differs from country to country and can be influenced by various factors, such as the availability of supplies at hospitals. In places like Italy, where the outbreak has been severe, the fatality rate has climbed as high as 11%. In places like South Korea, where outbreaks were mitigated with a massive testing program, the fatality rate has been just over 1%.\u00a0\nWe should also note that some social media users shared clips of \u201cMy Secret Terrius\u201d along with the claim that this was a \u201cChinese\u201d show. While that may play into the human-made bioweapon conspiracy theory (again, that is a false rumor), this show actually comes from South Korea.\u00a0\nIn short: A 2018 show South Korean show called \u201cMy Secret Terrius\u201d does mention the word \u201ccoronavirus.\u201d However, this term predates the show by several decades. Furthermore, the fictional virus does not share the same traits as the strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that was spreading around the world in early 2020.\u00a0\nIn other words, while COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus, not all coronaviruses cause COVID-19.\u00a0", "links": ["https://t.co/KqTZwA1IO2", "https://twitter.com/harbhajan_singh/status/1243184302336012292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html", "https://t.co/nuQ3UYZlMR", "https://twitter.com/eoeoes/status/1240320792547786752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/04/01/covid-19-bioweapon/", "https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200401-coronavirus-why-death-and-mortality-rates-differ", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/covid-19-discovered-us-south-korea/"], "imgs": []}
