The three new cases add up to the over 400 cases confirmed in Italy under a week.\nPope Francis missed a planned Mass with clergy in Rome yesterday after showing Coronavirus-like symptoms. The Vatican had earlier said the pontiff, 83, had a slight indisposition and could proceed with the rest of his planned work today.\nThe pope and his aides have been quarantined and receiving medical attention near Santa Marta, the Vatican hotel where he lives. The pope was seen coughing and blowing his nose during the Asha [sic] Wednesday Mass.\nThe MCM article was shared widely on social media and formed the basis of a video by YouTube user Chadd Sinclair, who repeated the article\u2019s claims.\nThose claims were false. As of late February, when MCM published its report, and March 3, when this fact check was published, the Vatican had not \u201cconfirmed\u201d that Francis or any of his aides had tested positive for the coronavirus. Moreover, according to one unconfirmed news report in Italy, the pope had actually tested negative for the disease.\nAt an Ash Wednesday service in the Vatican on Feb. 26, Francis was seen coughing and blowing his nose, causing some observers to speculate that the 83-year-old may have been among hundreds affected by a widespread coronavirus outbreak in Italy:\nHowever, on the following day Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni clarified that Francis was suffering only from a \u201cslight indisposition,\u201d and on Feb. 28 Bruni explicitly rejected suggestions that Francis had contracted coronavirus, telling reporters, \u201cThere is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition.\u201d\nOn March 1, the pope himself told followers at St. Peter\u2019s Square that he had a cold (\u201cil raffreddore\u201d) and would not be attending a Lenten retreat in the nearby town of Arricia.\u00a0\nNot only had the Vatican not \u201cconfirmed\u201d suspicions that Francis had tested positive for the coronavirus, but the Holy See had also explicitly rejected such claims, saying that Francis was only suffering from a cold. Much of MCM\u2019s article was actually plagiarized from an earlier Press Association report.\nOn March 3, the Italian newspaper Il Messagero reported that Francis had been tested for coronavirus and the result was negative. The article did not specify when he was tested and did not cite a source. As of March 3 the Vatican had not officially confirmed or corroborated the claim of a negative test result.\u00a0", "links": ["http://archive.is/JnMCG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200303150025/https://mcmnt.com/vatican-confirms-pope-francis-and-two-aides-test-positive-for-coronavirus/", "http://archive.is/FXfDa", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200303160819/https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2020-02/pope-francis-postpone-audiences-bruni-press-office.html", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200303162018/https://www.reuters.com/article/somnia-idUSKBN20O1NQ", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200303161923/http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2020/03/01/200301a.html", "http://archive.is/fuYgp", "http://archive.is/tSNK3"], "imgs": []}
