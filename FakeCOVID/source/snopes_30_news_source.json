Intensive care capacity is running short in Italy as the coronavirus continues to spread.\n\nThe document, produced by the civil protection department of the Piedmont region, one of those hardest hit, says: \"The criteria for access to intensive therapy in cases of emergency must include age of less than 80 or a score on the Charlson comorbidity Index [which indicates how many other medical conditions the patient has] of less than 5.\"\n\nThe ability of the patient to recover from resuscitation will also be considered.\n\nOne doctor said: \"[Who lives and who dies] is decided by age and by the [patient's] health conditions. This is how it is in a war.\"", "images": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/06/09/TELEMMGLPICT000232717033_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdqageXjD54/mqdefault.jpg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/14/TELEMMGLPICT000227698494_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpegimwidth=480", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/06/09/TELEMMGLPICT000001248520_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMSMuxhE33F3LbSB5YTtqB9VyDAc3XKXLAMq7J9AH4Vw.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/generic/Matt-cartoon-255x206px-small.png", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/06/09/TELEMMGLPICT000232301399_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/14/TELEMMGLPICT000227698494-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/06/08/TELEMMGLPICT000232684053_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agtKMm0Q094/mqdefault.jpg?imwidth=160"], "top_img": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/14/TELEMMGLPICT000227698494-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erica Di Blasi", "Global Health Security Team", "Our Foreign Staff", "Telegraph Reporters", "Julian Ryall"], "canonical_link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/14/italians-80-will-left-die-country-overwhelmed-coronavirus/", "title": "Italians over 80 'will be left to die' as country overwhelmed by coronavirus", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2c769d", "msapplication-TileImage": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Telegraph", "msapplication-config": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-70x70.png", "description": "Hardest-hit region drafts new proposals saying who will live and who will die", "keywords": "News,Standard,Europe,Italy,World News,Coronavirus", "tmgads.channel": "news", "tmgads.section": "news-2020", "tmgads.zone": "news.2020.03.14", "tmgads.articleid": "At9tYfvFHkW0", "tmgads.pagetype": "story", "tmgads.level": 5, "tmgads.geo": "US", "tmgads.keywords": "News,Standard,Europe,Italy,World News,Coronavirus", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.Category": 2020, "DCSext.Genre": 3, "DCSext.MLC": "/news/2020/03/14", "DCSext.articleId": "At9tYfvFHkW0", "DCSext.Content_Type": "story", "DCSext.Level": 5, "DCSext.author": "Erica Di Blasi", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2020-03-14 16:38", "DCSext.cf": 0, "DCSext.cd": 0, "DCSext.cn": 0, "DCSext.pd": 1, "og": {"title": "Italians over 80 'will be left to die' as country overwhelmed by coronavirus", "description": "Hardest-hit region drafts new proposals saying who will live and who will die", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Telegraph", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/14/italians-80-will-left-die-country-overwhelmed-coronavirus/", "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/14/TELEMMGLPICT000227698494-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200"}, "twitter": {"title": "Italians over 80 'will be left to die' as country overwhelmed by coronavirus", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/14/italians-80-will-left-die-country-overwhelmed-coronavirus/", "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/14/TELEMMGLPICT000227698494-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "site": "@TelegraphNews", "description": "Hardest-hit region drafts new proposals saying who will live and who will die", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "tmgads.businessSegment": "news", "tmg.premium.override": "true", "tmg.premium.state": "false", "premiumContentOnFirstPublish": "true", "article": {"content_tier": "free"}, "fb": {"pages": 122346694516955}, "theme-color": "#072A3A", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#072A3A", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:standard,max-video-preview:-1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1584158400.0, "source": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk", "summary": ""}
