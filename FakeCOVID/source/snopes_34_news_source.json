(President Barack Obama named Ron Klain, a Democratic operative, to coordinate the government\u2019s response to the Ebola virus.)\n\nWhile calling out the president\u2019s proposed cuts to funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ms. Klobuchar also delivered faint praise of Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to invite the agency\u2019s principal deputy director to address the nation alongside him. \u201cHe did do it with the C.D.C.,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s important, because I believe in science.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren in recent days has pointed to a plan she released weeks ago focused on combating infectious disease outbreaks. On Wednesday she escalated her proposal, with the specific suggestion of redirecting the border-wall money to address the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe know that with any virus that develops, the most vulnerable will be our children, seniors, people with compromised immune systems,\u201d she said. \u201cThis one is tough.\u201d\n\nMr. Bloomberg, too, planned to step up his message on Thursday, when his campaign will begin airing a new television ad nationally that is focused on the virus. \u201cHealth experts warn the U.S. is underprepared,\u201d the ad begins. \u201cManaging a crisis is what Mike Bloomberg does.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the commercial Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign tore into the president. \u201cTrump is putting American lives at risk every day, ignoring science, claiming the virus will \u2018miraculously\u2019 disappear by April and relying on \u2018warm weather\u2019 to end the spread of the virus,\u201d the campaign said in a news release.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump issued a message on Twitter criticizing the news media for \u201cdoing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible.\u201d He added, \u201cLikewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/27/world/27dems-coronavirus/27dems-coronavirus-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-rebecca-r-ruiz/author-rebecca-r-ruiz-thumbLarge.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/27/world/27dems-coronavirus/merlin_169592598_b2ab2861-06b0-4bd4-b588-e862014bd7d0-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/27/world/27dems-coronavirus/27dems-coronavirus-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca R.
