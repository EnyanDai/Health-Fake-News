Their report details how sick bats urinated, attacked and bled on researchers, who did their best to quarantine themselves. But the disease still spread through Wuhan, across China and throughout the world.\n\nThe new report by biological scientists from the prestigious South China University of Technology in Guangzhou, China, contradicts Beijing, who said it spread from contaminated bats being sold at a food market. Biologists Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao, published a pre-print entitled \"The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus\u201d, in the report they described how \u201cthe killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan\u201d. The report added: \u201cWe noted two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus in Wuhan, one of which was only 280 metres from the seafood market. \u201cWe briefly examined the histories of the laboratories and proposed that the coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory\n\nA Wuhan high security laboratory\n\n\u201cOur proposal provided an alternative origin of the coronavirus in addition to natural recombination and intermediate host.\u201d The scientists in the alarming report contested official findings that the pathogen first made the jump from bats to humans in the Wuhan wet market. They said: \u201cThe probability was very low for the bats to fly to the market. \u201cAccording to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors, the bat was never a food source in the city, and no bat was traded in the market.

These laboratories were within 280 meters of the market, one is called the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The research concludes that this laboratory hosted animals for research purposes, one of which was specialised in pathogens collection and identification.

The expert who studied the collection of bats at the laboratory had described how he was once \u201cattacked by bats and the blood of a bat shot onto his skin\u201d. The paper added: \u201cHe knew the extreme danger of the infection so he quarantined himself for fourteen days. \u201cIn another accident, he quarantined himself again because bats urinated on him.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese economy is suffering due to the virus\n\nThe scientists claim the laboratory is beside the Union Hospital where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic. The paper concluded: \u201cIt is plausible that the virus leaked out and contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future studies.\u201d A second laboratory was identified around seven miles from the seafood market, belonging to Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This laboratory reported the Chinese horseshoe bats are a natural reservoir for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV, which caused the 2002 to 2003 pandemic.\n\nPatient being taken for treatment\n\nTrending", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1242801.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/285x190/1242768_1.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/285x190/1242773_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/285x190/1242757_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/285x190/1242750_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/covers/70x91/front_2020-06-08.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035737&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1242801.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Mcgleenon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1242801/coronavirus-lab-leak-chinese-pathogen-laboratory-scientists-wuhan-wet-market-bioweapon", "title": "Coronavirus bombshell: \u2018REAL cause\u2019 of outbreak claim - Chinese scientists break cover", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "CORONAVIRUS spread from a science laboratory in Wuhan and not a \u2018wet market', a group of Chinese scientists have sensationally claimed.", "fb": {"pages": 129617873765147, "app_id": 823607694325129}, "og": {"title": "Coronavirus bombshell: \u2018REAL cause\u2019 of outbreak claim - Chinese scientists break cover", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1242801/coronavirus-lab-leak-chinese-pathogen-laboratory-scientists-wuhan-wet-market-bioweapon", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1242801.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "headlines,world,ctp_video,autoplay_video,coronavirus,lab leak,chinese pathogen,laboratory,scientists,wuhan,wet market,bioweapon", "section": "World", "description": "CORONAVIRUS spread from a science laboratory in Wuhan and not a \u2018wet market', a group of Chinese scientists have sensationally claimed."}, "news_keywords": "headlines,world,ctp_video,autoplay_video,coronavirus,lab leak,chinese pathogen,laboratory,scientists,wuhan,wet market,bioweapon", "article": {"tag": "bioweapon", "published_time": "2020-02-16T00:17:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-16T00:18:21+00:00", "expiration_time": "2020-03-17", "section": "World", "image_count": 5, "video_count": 1, "word_count": 830, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0}, "author": "Brian McGleenon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1242801.jpg"}, "title": "Coronavirus bombshell: \u2018REAL cause\u2019 of outbreak claim - Chinese scientists break cover", "description": "CORONAVIRUS spread from a science laboratory in Wuhan and not a \u2018wet market', a group of Chinese scientists have sensationally claimed."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "Coronavirus bombshell: \u2018REAL cause\u2019 of outbreak claim - Chinese scientists break cover", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "noodp,noydir,all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1581812220.0, "source": "https://www.express.co.uk", "summary": ""}
