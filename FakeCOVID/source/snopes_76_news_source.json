He is not being replaced.\n\nAD\n\nPandemic preparedness and global health security are issues that require government-wide responses, experts say, as well as the leadership of a high-ranking official within the White House who is assigned only this role.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHealth security is very fragmented, with many different agencies,\u201d said J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt means coordination and direction from the White House is terribly important. \u201d\n\nThe personnel changes, which Morrison and others characterize as a downgrading of global health security, are part of Bolton\u2019s previously announced plans to streamline the NSC. Two members of Ziemer's team have been merged into a unit in charge of weapons of mass destruction, and another official's position is now part of a unit responsible for international organizations. White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, who had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks, is out completely. He left the day after Bolton took over last month.\n\nAD\n\nNSC spokesman Robert Palladino said Wednesday the administration \u201cremains committed to global health, global health security and biodefense, and will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnother administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, acknowledged it was only one of many administration priorities. \u201cIn a world of limited resources, you have to pick and choose,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lost a little bit of the leadership, but the expertise remains.\u201d\n\nZiemer is a well-respected public health leader who was considered highly effective leading the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative under George W. Bush and Barack Obama before joining the NSC last year. While Palladino said he left \u201con the warmest terms,\u201d an individual familiar with the specifics behind the reorganization said \u201che was basically pushed out. He struggled to preserve himself and the integrity of his team, and he failed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHis exit comes against the backdrop of other administration actions critics say have weakened health security preparedness, including dwindling financing for early preventive action against infectious disease threats abroad.\n\nAD\n\nThe new Ebola outbreak is in northwest Congo. Only two cases have been confirmed, but the World Health Organization reported Thursday another 30 probable and suspected cases of the deadly hemorrhagic fever. Of those, 18 already have died.\n\nCongolese and international health officials say they hope to control the outbreak quickly, but some health officials worry about its potential to become more serious and spread because of its location in a town upriver from the densely populated capital of Kinshasa.\n\nAD\n\nThis week, the administration released a list of $15 billion in spending cuts it wants Congress to approve. Among the targets is $252 million in unused funds remaining from the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people, far exceeding the combined total cases reported in about 20 previous outbreaks since the 1970s.\n\nAD\n\nThe White House proposal \u201cis threatening to claw back funding whose precise purpose is to help the United States be able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis,\u201d said Carolyn Reynolds, a vice president at PATH, a global health technology nonprofit.\n\nCollectively, warns Jeremy Konyndyk, who led foreign disaster assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Obama administration, \u201cWhat this all adds up to is a potentially really concerning rollback of progress on U.S. health security preparedness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over the last 15 years,\u201d said Konyndyk, now a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. \u201cThese moves make us materially less safe. It\u2019s inexplicable.\u201d\n\nThe day before news of Ziemer\u2019s exit became public, one of the officials on his team, Luciana Borio, director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the NSC, spoke at a symposium at Emory University to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic. That event killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe threat of pandemic flu is the number one health security concern,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cAre we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKaren DeYoung contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WT_W4s-y1o6goqAaN3vY-E3J-Gs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3U2TBD3JGUYR5OU5GDDOKD44LY.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KMAAO3W6NI4GHGINOOKK4YJZCI.jpg&w=150", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/a26342b5-8039-48cd-9aa0-2f4871bb7694.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WT_W4s-y1o6goqAaN3vY-E3J-Gs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3U2TBD3JGUYR5OU5GDDOKD44LY.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lena H.
