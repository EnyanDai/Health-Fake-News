Jensen said for example if the same patient had pneumonia during flu season and he didn\u2019t have a test confirming the patient also had influenza, he would never diagnose the patient with influenza on the death certificate.\n\nTRENDING: INSANE!

However, the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID- 19 being the underlying cause more often than not,\u201d the guidelines read.\n\nDr. Birx on Tuesday told a reporter during a Coronavirus task force briefing, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a very liberal approach to mortality.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you talk about your concerns about deaths being misreported by Coronavirus because of either testing or standards for how they are characterized?\u201d the reporter asked Birx.\n\n\u201cIf someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death,\u201d Birx said.\n\nThere is a big difference between dying with the virus and from the virus.", "images": ["https://bh.contextweb.com/bh/set.aspx?action=add&pid=1&advid=5248&token=LCMHRD&do=add", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fcd769f394c702a36aab350518d6abae?s=96&d=mm", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0474.jpg", "https://c.statcounter.com/9449268/0/3cc87ae0/0/", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/1-325-345x181.jpg", "https://static.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0474-600x338.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20480112&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/Fauci-Coronavirus-Trump-Face-Palm-1-Screen-Image-032020-345x181.jpg", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0920-1-345x181.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0474.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cristina Laila", "Cristina Began Writing For The Gateway Pundit In", "She Is Currently The Associate Editor."], "canonical_link": "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/04/huge-mn-senator-dr-reveals-hhs-document-coaching-overcount-covid-19-cases-copy-document-video/", "title": "HUGE!
