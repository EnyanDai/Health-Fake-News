They can also use losses to avoid paying taxes in other years.\n\nThat gives the roughly 43,000 individual tax filers who make at least $1 million a year a savings of $70.3 billion \u2014 or about $1.6 million apiece, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nHedge-fund investors and real estate business owners are \u201cfar and away\u201d the ones who will benefit the most, tax expert Steve Rosenthal told the Washington Post.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) called it a \u201cscandal\u201d to \u201cloot American taxpayers in the midst of an economic and human tragedy.\u201d\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) claimed that \u201csomeone wrongly seized on this health emergency to reward ultrarich beneficiaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor those earning $1 million annually, a tax break buried in the recent coronavirus relief legislation is so generous that its total cost is more than total new funding for all hospitals in America and more than the total provided to all state and local governments,\u201d he stressed in a statement.", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/200416-sheldon-whitehouse.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/knewz_300x250.png"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/200416-sheldon-whitehouse.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["April"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2020/04/16/43k-us-millionaires-will-get-stimulus-averaging-1-6m-each/", "title": "Over 43,000 US millionaires will get \u2018stimulus\u2019 averaging $1.6 million each", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
