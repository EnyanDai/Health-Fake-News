You think when governments have full control of assets they become more just and free? Look at history. It's never worked once. Consumerism is disgusting at times but it has brought a better quality of life for most. \nThe more power a government has the more the abuse it. Every one ever with no exceptions. \nThe only way for a just world is power closer to local community and further away from government. Personal responsibility and sustainability on a local level, billionaires aren't going to offer the solution, they just want to make sure they remain billionaires. \nThe more we look out for leaders the more we get screwed. Far left and far right both lead to the same thing. Both sensor and control but under different guises. The Nazis done pretty well under socialism, country was leading the world in lots of areas, science, art etc under them, but we all know how that went. Far left and far right both lead to millions of deaths. History has taught us that well.", "created_utc": 1585813934.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm75g6r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ftdngr", "parent_id": "t1_fm6g111", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9a", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm75g6r", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldpolitics/comments/ftdngr/when_the_next_pandemic_occurs_and_make_no_mistake/fm75g6r/"}
