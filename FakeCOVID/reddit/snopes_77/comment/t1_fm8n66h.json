We see what \"effective\" looks like... South Korea.  They went straight to the **private sector** to develop their tests. 20 different companies were in competition to win the bid. Within a week, they had already approved one company's test and were in the approval process on a second test from a different company.\n\nOur Federal Pandemic Response group would not have been able to force the CDC to use ANY of the tests that already existed.  NO, they still would have insisted on doing their own and wasted weeks developing the faulty ones.  Then the FDA wasted another **5 WEEKS** finally approving tests developed outside the CDC.  Would our wonderful pandemic group have been able to stop that?  Not a chance.\n\nAnd as I said earlier.... we KNOW they would have not been able to magically create the supplies we needed.", "created_utc": 1585852414.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm8n66h", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ftdngr", "parent_id": "t1_fm70h79", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9a", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm8n66h", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldpolitics/comments/ftdngr/when_the_next_pandemic_occurs_and_make_no_mistake/fm8n66h/"}
