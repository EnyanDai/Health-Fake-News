My wife (who has been by my side since Europe) tested negative.\u201d \n\n> Simpson is now in quarantine at his home, but otherwise appears to not be suffering from any major complications from the virus. \u201cAll I know is I first felt symptoms a month ago yet Im still positive and contagious \u2026 really wishing Id taken my wife\u2019s advice and put a bathroom in the floor plans..live and learn. But hey, at least our Government appointed task force headed by a man who does not believe in science is against mass testing and we now have a second task force in the works to \u2018open America back up for business\u2019! Dick Daddy out.\u201d\n\nGlad to know it seems like he\u2019s on the upward trend of beating it.
