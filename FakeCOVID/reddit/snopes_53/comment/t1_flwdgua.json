Because a lot of those 137000 are in the early stages.\n\nYes, Deaths will lag behind confirmed cases, which is one of the flaws to translating CFR to a \"mortality rate\" in an on going disease and one of the reasons why it should NOT be used as the \"mortality rate\" reflective of actual risk to the population. \n\nCase fatality rates (1.7% right now) only give you the mortality rate for those who have confirmed cases that have died. Its extremely sensitive to both testing ability/bias and only tells you a patients survival rate if they are confirmed to have the disease, in the hospital, at that specific given time. \n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/covid-mortality-risk\n\nMy point is, that for actual population projection death rates, or risk assessment, you should be looking at Infection Fatality rates and estimating total cases. The reported CFR is largely irrelevant unless you are in the hospital as a patient or doctor right now.", "created_utc": 1585546910.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flwdgua", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fr8i87", "parent_id": "t1_flvxphr", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flwdgua", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fr8i87/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flwdgua/"}
