Comparison of curative effect between experimental group and control groupDuring  the course of treatment, one patient in the test group developed severe  and the test drug was discontinued on the fourth day. In the  intention-to-treat analysis, on the seventh day after enrollment, 13  patients (86.7%) in the test group and 14 patients (93.3%) in the  control group were negative for pharynx swab virus nucleic acid (P>  0.05). During the 2-week visit period, all subjects' throat nucleic acid  swab virus nucleic acid test turned negative. The test group's throat  swab virus nucleic acid negative time was 4 (1-9) days after admission.  The control group For the second (1 \\~ 4) days, the difference was not  statistically significant (U = 83.5, P> 0.05). The body temperature  returned to normal on the first day (0 \\~ 2) after admission, and the  body temperature returned to normal on the first (0 \\~ 3) day after  admission. In terms of imaging performance, 5 cases in the test group  (33.3%) and 7 cases in the control group (46.7%) showed progress in the  review after 3 days of enrollment. All patients showed improvement of  the lesions in the subsequent review. By the end of the follow-up  period, all subjects had survived.  \n\n\n[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COvid-19&term=hydroxychloroquine&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&fbclid=IwAR3w38m46dZN6IbfxHFYI5wuqURUiOcjLV\\_pWitv4JiDQBNBDuhfrKA9Ay4](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COvid-19&term=hydroxychloroquine&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&fbclid=IwAR3w38m46dZN6IbfxHFYI5wuqURUiOcjLV_pWitv4JiDQBNBDuhfrKA9Ay4)", "created_utc": 1585656564.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm0fxtx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fs9e4m", "parent_id": "t3_fs9e4m", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm0fxtx", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fs9e4m/new_york_physician_dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now/fm0fxtx/"}
