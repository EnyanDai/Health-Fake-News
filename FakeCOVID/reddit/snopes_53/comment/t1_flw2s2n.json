As a general rule of thumb, if they dont have known, congenital QTc prolongation, you dont even think twice about administering these qtc prolonging agents. \n\nIt's interesting you quote a cardiologist for this, because as I'm sure you can intuitively tell, cardiology doesnt have a huge role in treating coronavirus. And of course, the one thing they're gonna focus on is the rare cardiac effect of hydroxychloroquine. I dont think it adds much to the conversation. For comparison, Z-pack can also cause cardiac conduction abnormalities (including sudden cardiac arrest), but how absurd would it be for us to freak out about people blindly popping Z-Packs, and warning people not to take it without a doctors orders?\n\nEvery medication should be administered under the care of a physician. Theres literally no way to get hydroxychloroquine without a doctor's prescription....
