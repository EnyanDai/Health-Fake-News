There's no clinical trial for it, because in order to do so you have to give people a placebo as well.  Which is effectively killing people for the sake of 'scope of trial.'  On the other hand with this being officially a pandemic, and \"right to try\" it means that any patient with the disease can opt to have it.  \n\nIf ~700 people have consented(or their family have on their behalf) and all of them recovered earlier then the norm.  Then it becomes a valuable treatment outside of a clinical setting in order to save people and it reduces the number of people who would get to that critical state in the first place.
