You're referring to one mini trial, which in itself maybe isnt going to be much. But over the past few weeks/month, there is mounting evidence of its utility, with a lot more being not only published in reputable medical journals, but being discussed amongst medical experts/professionals. Theres a reason the consensus amongst most medical professionals that theres utility in using these medications. It goes beyond FDA approval and a couple of unimpressive trials. Case reports, hospital statistics, meta analyses, etc go into it too.\n\nAnd finally, just emphasizing a previous talking point it seems we both agree on, this is a decision for physicians to make. The average person cant just get over the counter hydroxychloroquine. So the overall rhetoric of criticizing its use, to any degree, is indirectly criticizing a physician for using their medical judgement. Obviously I'm biased, but if an ICU doctor looks at the body of evidence and decides it's the correct thing to do, I'm going to trust that 100 out of 100 times over a lay person's interpretation of the same data.", "created_utc": 1585577621.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flx8f36", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fr8i87", "parent_id": "t1_flwn1dh", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flx8f36", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fr8i87/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flx8f36/"}
