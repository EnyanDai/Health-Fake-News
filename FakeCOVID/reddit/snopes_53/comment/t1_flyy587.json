The vaccine is in a patch with preloaded micro-needles, that leaves behind an invisible marker as a vaccine certification. There's no mention whatsoever of of a chip there and nothing linking it to id2020 apart from speculation. \n\nThe world's smallest microchip is 0.4mm square - these crystals are 0.000004mm square, with a protective coating that lasts 5 years taking them to 0.02mm. \n\nThe progression of thought - id2020 to chips to forcible vaccination that put those chips in is a stretch at best. \n\nYes, id2020 will work better with an RFID implant, since that's harder to steal or lose. \n\nYes they are working on a contraceptive implant that's able to be turned off and on at will.\n\nYes they want to create a way of keeping vaccination records without a paper trail that can be lost.\n\nBut connecting the 3 and deciding it will happen by force is not a sensible position. \n\nMeanwhile Elon musk has started development of a machine/brain interface, and no-one bats an eye.", "created_utc": 1585611493.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flyy587", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_frtycw", "parent_id": "t1_flymhfc", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flyy587", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/frtycw/update_dr_zelenko_has_now_treated_699_coronavirus/flyy587/"}
