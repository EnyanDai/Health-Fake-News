The only place that's had time to complete a properly conducted clinical trial is China. In evaluating efficacy of treatments we basically have 2 kinds of sources:\n\n* Clinical studies from China\n* Observational reports from doctors in France, US, etc\n\nI think you also need to distinguish between Chinese scientists/doctors and the CCP. This paper will be submitted and peer reviewed by an international journal. XJP won't be the reviewer. Normally results from a study like this wouldn't be available for months, until it is published. But the scientists are sharing the preprint because they believe the information could save lives.\n\nTake it all with a grain of salt, sure. But the early evidence so far points to CQ being a promising treatment. My opinion is we should be using it until there's a randomised clinical trial proving that it doesn't work", "created_utc": 1585691235.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm2601z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fs9e4m", "parent_id": "t1_fm0uz09", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm2601z", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fs9e4m/new_york_physician_dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now/fm2601z/"}
