These flavonoids have also a much better safety profile than chloroquine, with a potentially harmful dose as much as 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than the assumed effective dose.\n\n1. Zinc plus ionophores [can block replication of corona viruses](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001176https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001176) (at least in vitro) \n2. Chloroquine is a ionophore, so its positive effects [might be attributed to the weaponisation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4182877/pdf/pone.0109180.pdf0.1371/journal.pone.0109180) of zinc present in the patients, in this case administering zinc supplements could increase its effectiveness (and lack thereof might instead explain when it does not work)\n3. The effect of chloroquine reported by Prof. Raoult and other is consistent with the effects of zinc, i.e. a shorter infection period, even though there is [no mention of zinc in his papers](https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-IHU-2-1.pdf): *\u201cA rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load tested by qPCR was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% patients at Day5. This allowed patients to rapidly de discharge from highly contagious wards with a mean length of stay of five days*.\u201d \n4. chloroquine has side effects, while other ionophores like [quercetin and epigallocatechin-gallate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25050823) don\u2019t \n\nThis suggests a preventive treatment of 500mg quercetine and 25mg zinc (and more, up to 400mg, in case of infection) to the general population might reduce the symptoms and duration, thus flattening the curve, while having a low cost and no known side effects", "created_utc": 1585681603.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm1ngjg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_frxej3", "parent_id": "t3_frxej3", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2ugkz", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585683190.0, "name": "t1_fm1ngjg", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/frxej3/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/fm1ngjg/"}
