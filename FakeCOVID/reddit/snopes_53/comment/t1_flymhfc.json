It was last year in December when scientists from the two universities revealed that they were working on these quantum-dot tattoos after Bill Gates approached them about solving the problem of identifying those who have not been vaccinated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe quantum-dot tattoos will likely be supplemented with Bill Gates\u2019 other undertaking called ID2020, which is an ambitious project by Microsoft to solve the problem of over 1 billion people who live without an officially recognized identity. ID2020 is solving this through digital identity. Currently, the most feasible way of implementing digital identity is either through smartphones or RFID microchip implants. The latter will be Gates\u2019s likely approach not only because of feasibility and sustainability, but also because for over 6 years, the Gates Foundation has been funding another project that incorporates human-implantable microchip implants. This project, also spearheaded by MIT, is a birth control microchip implant that will allow women to control contraceptive hormones in their bodies.\u201d\n\nhttps://biohackinfo.com/news-bill-gates-id2020-vaccine-implant-covid-19-digital-certificates/\n\nLook at this implantable \u201cchip\u201d for contraception.\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/528121/a-contraceptive-implant-with-remote-control/\n\nYou lose, pal.", "created_utc": 1585604924.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flymhfc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_frtycw", "parent_id": "t1_flyln9o", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flymhfc", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/frtycw/update_dr_zelenko_has_now_treated_699_coronavirus/flymhfc/"}
