If these are all mild cases, it is likely that they all would have recovered anyway.\n\nAssuming a basal 1% mortality rate, we would expect that 692 patients would recover on their own. However, if these are mild clinical cases to begin with, which is what it seems given the low number of hospitalized patients, the mortality rate would be substantially lower. Even if it is 0.5% (which is likely an overestimate for mild cases), then one would expect 695 recoveries, which is within the range of statistical noise. The fact that all patients recovered could just as well be explained as all patients recovering on their own. It would be valuable to see data on the viral load, clinical severity, and demographics of the patients he treated, because it may be that full recovery is exactly what you'd expect without intervention.\n\nThis is why randomized controlled trial data combined with statistical analyses are necessary to show that hydroxychloroquine is effective.", "created_utc": 1585521033.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flvco4v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fr8i87", "parent_id": "t3_fr8i87", "score": 37, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flvco4v", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fr8i87/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flvco4v/"}
