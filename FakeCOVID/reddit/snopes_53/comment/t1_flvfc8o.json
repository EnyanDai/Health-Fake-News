Moreover, given that there were only a few initial hospitalizations, this suggests that the patients primarily presented with mild symptoms, in which case the case fatality rate would be lower. All patients recovering is a reasonable outcome to predict even without clinical intervention.\n\nThis is all to say that we don't know how many people might have been saved, because there is no control group to compare to. We need that in order to see whether more people are in fact recovering with treatment than would without treatment. Given that even at a 1% case fatality rate, we expect that 692 patients \u00b1 some error would recover, we really cannot conclude anything from these data. Given even a slight bias towards younger patients and milder cases, we should see pretty much expect to see full recovery.\n\nWhat this all points to is the need for randomized controlled trials, which are currently ongoing. Hopefully those show this to be an effective treatment regimen. It certainly has shown promise in lessening disease severity in case studies", "created_utc": 1585522615.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flvfc8o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fr8i87", "parent_id": "t1_flulorw", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585522989.0, "name": "t1_flvfc8o", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fr8i87/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flvfc8o/"}
