I heard that there had been some promising evidence about this treatment several weeks before Trump ever mentioned it, while it was still contained to mostly Asian countries. Now there is just MORE and MORE clinical testimony and evidence coming up independently, from multiple different countries, supporting the idea that this treatment is at least somewhat effective. Hell, the company that makes Hydroxychloroquine even jacked up the price after the first preliminary evidence out of China.\n\nAnyways, I just don't understand how so many people are dismissing this potentially life saving therapy regimen just because Trump talked about it. It's possibly the stupidest anti-Trump behavior I've seen so far.\n\nThe other really stupid thing I remember is when everybody was saying Trump had dementia because he was trying to negotiate a purchase of Greenland from Denmark. Greenland's ice sheet is one of the largest freshwater reserves in the world, the Arctic Ocean is becoming the most geopolitically important body of water due to the diminishing sea ice, and with global warming Greenland might be fertile land in 80 years. People criticized Thomas Jefferson for the Louisiana Purchase too. I actually suspect that military brass informed Trump of the strategic value of Greenland which is why he was trying to make a deal.", "created_utc": 1585550998.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flwhn93", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_frd581", "parent_id": "t1_flv8o1i", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9a", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585586572.0, "name": "t1_flwhn93", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldpolitics/comments/frd581/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flwhn93/"}
