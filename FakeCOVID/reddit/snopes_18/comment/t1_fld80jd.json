Best case scenario, it does nothing other than give you the false sense of having done something effective. If that leaves you neglecting *actually* effective habits you're worse off. This post claims to be a \"cure\" so if an infected person does this and believes they're cured and starts acting as such, they become extremely dangerous.\n\nWorst case scenario, for the individual at least, is they do aspirate some of the concoction, kickstarting the damage to their lungs before the virus fully incubates. This would likely lead to what could be a mild case being worse than it needs to be.\n\nLong story short, seek your information on how to protect yourself and others directly from sources that know what they are talking about. Go to the CDC's website and look at their suggested practices and don't trust anything that could be \"too good to be true\" since it's likely dangerously false.", "created_utc": 1585058785.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fld80jd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fk6ujf", "parent_id": "t1_fld741x", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3acf2", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fld80jd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/fk6ujf/gargling_with_warm_water_salt_or_vinegar/fld80jd/"}
