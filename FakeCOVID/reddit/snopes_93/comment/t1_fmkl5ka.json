He\u2019s a tough guy but I\u2019ve never seen him so taken out by being sick \u2014 he went to the doctors, who assured him it was the flu. When the test came back negative, they really had no explanation and told him he had pneumonia and let him go on his way. A few weeks ago, when all the shit hit the fan, my dad called me, confident that what he had was COVID-19 back in January. I brushed it off and called him crazy, but the more and more I think about, the more I think that it\u2019s entirely plausible that he did, in fact, have it. Hopefully antibody tests will be commonplace at some point in the future so we can know for sure.", "created_utc": 1586158785.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkl5ka", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlejf", "parent_id": "t1_fmjbhwf", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s6h3", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkl5ka", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/moderatepolitics/comments/fvlejf/official_counts_understate_the_us_coronavirus/fmkl5ka/"}
