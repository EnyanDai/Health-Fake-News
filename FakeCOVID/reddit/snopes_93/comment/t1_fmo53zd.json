Currently the data is being revised. Originally deaths and cases were being overstated. As more data is coming in, death toll projections are decreasing. This is exactly what we would expect. Original models were based on Chinese and Italian data, much more densely populated areas and also locked down late, so they had high transmission and ICUs were overflowing. There is very good news (cautiously) that the US is starting to get a handle on the virus. Less densely populated areas in the US are showing much slower case growth and death rates. It can change, but it's still good news.\n\n [http://www.healthdata.org/covid/updates](http://www.healthdata.org/covid/updates)", "created_utc": 1586245708.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmo53zd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fw27vl", "parent_id": "t3_fw27vl", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmo53zd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fw27vl/official_counts_understate_the_us_coronavirus/fmo53zd/"}
