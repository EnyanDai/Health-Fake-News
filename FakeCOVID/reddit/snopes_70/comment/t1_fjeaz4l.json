I'm generally on his side here, but disinformation like that is just repulsive. And I'm not a big fan of a lot of things the catholic church did, I'm definitely not on the churches side here, but this is just bad.\n\nThe 70% figure is ridiculous. [Here](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/04/us/catholic-church-300-million-abuse-claims/index.html) they say they spend 300 million on abuse-related costs in the US, 2/3rds of which went to settlements, a tenth to lawyers. That is a lot, too much, but you don't need to know anything to guess that that isn't 70% of what they made. In fact it is rather hard to find out how much they did make, I would guess the pope himself has no idea because there are just so many different branches and charities that are kind of independent but not really, [the best I could find on the quick](https://slate.com/business/2013/03/catholic-church-revenue-one-of-america-s-biggest-businesses.html) says they spent 170 billion in 2010 in the US on hospitals and education alone. So while 300 million still *is so much money* it isn't even a fraction of what they made.\n\nAnd the catholic church hasn't 'lost' in Germany at least, I won't go around and make sweeping statements about whole continents and proclaim they are fine everywhere, I like to stick to what I know. Any here they still play a vital role in our communities, not only in terms of religion but a lot of social things for heathens and heretics alike. Where even if we wanted to get rid of them, the short term cost would be immense. \n\nI don't feel like picking his post apart more, use your head, and if somebody makes insane claims with no source, maybe don't trust the rest of what they say. Maybe some of it is true, maybe not, but if a liar says something that could be true I don't tend to pay much mind to it.", "created_utc": 1583268462.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjeaz4l", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fcr58u", "parent_id": "t1_fje59ub", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjeaz4l", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fcr58u/pope_tests_negative_for_coronavirus_italy_report/fjeaz4l/"}
