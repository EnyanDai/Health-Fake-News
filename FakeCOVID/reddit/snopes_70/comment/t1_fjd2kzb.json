You can see how he was trying to be more progressive in his early days but appeared to get reigned in.\n\nHe also said something like: \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Ok loads of people will say, \"oh is that all?\" but for the pope himself to say something like that is a big change of direction.\n\nEdit: just remembered something else. He also refuses to follow a lot of protocol that makes him out to be some sort of king e.g. he hates when people try to kiss his ring etc. I also read he refuses to live in the popes palace and stays in a much more modest accommodation.", "created_utc": 1583244096.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjd2kzb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fcr58u", "parent_id": "t1_fjd22l6", "score": 75, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1583269584.0, "name": "t1_fjd2kzb", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fcr58u/pope_tests_negative_for_coronavirus_italy_report/fjd2kzb/"}
