JPII was very elderly and disabled during the North American revelations. Bendy Dick was originally picked to be someone who could handle the storm left to him and it almost cost the Catholics the entire continent of South America. That's why they picked Francis the first non European Pope to replace him. \n\nThe Catholic Church has basically lost the game in Western Europe and North America.  I don't know anyone on east coast America willing to donate to the Catholic Church anymore after 7 out of ten dollars in donations goes to settling child molestation. I don't care how religious you personally are,  when you realize 70 cents on every dollar you give to those fuckers is just lawyer fees and payouts, you're not going to give them another penny. \n\nThe institution has run out of all credibility and no one respects the church anymore. Fifty years ago every Irish and Italian mother told beat their child if they mouthed off that opinion. Now they're agreeing with their kids and said enough is enough let's just pray the rosary and fuck the church itself.", "created_utc": 1583261036.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjdxas9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fcr58u", "parent_id": "t1_fjdoud0", "score": -6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjdxas9", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fcr58u/pope_tests_negative_for_coronavirus_italy_report/fjdxas9/"}
