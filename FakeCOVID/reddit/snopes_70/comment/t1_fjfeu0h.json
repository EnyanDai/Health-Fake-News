Needless to say, the whole thing is a fair bit more complex than \"church didn't like science\" \n\nIn fact some key objections of the church were on scientific grounds and really did present obstacles to Galileo's theory that he did not well address.\n\nThe whole thing existed at the confluence of complicated court politics, science, theology, philosophy and culture. \n\nOf course none of this is to say that there weren't figures acting dogmatically in the face of better evidence, only that that was but one small part of a much more complex situation. And of course if dogmatically refusing to accept better evidence when it is presented, then \"science\" and scientific institutions are as guilty as the church on that front. (Consider hand washing in medicine for example)\n\nIn summary, I have a bit of trouble buying to the whole \"Science vs religion\" narrative. It seems to be a relic of 19th century historiography that while still popular falls apart with any real scrutiny.\n\nFor what it is worth, historians of science tend to think the same, favoring a much more complex and nuanced perspective on how science has (and has not) developed over time.", "created_utc": 1583290332.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjfeu0h", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fcr58u", "parent_id": "t1_fjf9vnq", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjfeu0h", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fcr58u/pope_tests_negative_for_coronavirus_italy_report/fjfeu0h/"}
