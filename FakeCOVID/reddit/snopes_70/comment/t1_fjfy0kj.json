On the other hand, they did nothing whatsoever to Copernicus or Kepler, both Catholic, both had similar views.\n\nThe fact is, Galileo's evidence for a heliocentric universe was not very good, and when he insulted the Pope, he managed to get the whole subject declared a heresy. It's not a particularly good moment for the Church, but trying to claim the primary motivation for the conviction was really about heliocentrism is quite misguided, when the Pope himself asked Galileo to write a book on the topic.", "created_utc": 1583303798.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjfy0kj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fcr58u", "parent_id": "t1_fjf9vnq", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjfy0kj", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fcr58u/pope_tests_negative_for_coronavirus_italy_report/fjfy0kj/"}
