Why would you think I'm comparing it to indoors? The beach is worse than other outdoor spaces. \n\nThe protection provided by indoor isolation is by both being cut off from others and limiting movement which could allow for more interactions with more people. The spread in indoor environments isn't even a comparable factor. The point is staying home rather staying in a crowded work building. Your social interactions are limited to just your household. But if anyone in your house gets sick you'll all get it, but the isolation then further protects others because you won't be out spreading it.\n\nBut a crowd at a beach is worse than indoors because you have many different people from many different places in the open together and at risk from that contact. The wind and moisture makes it worse than a place like a park.\n\nA beach is the worst place to pick to crowd around with strangers outdoors in this pandemic.", "created_utc": 1587347727.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnxwb72", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3wp7j", "parent_id": "t1_fnx4w1t", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnxwb72", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/g3wp7j/hundreds_flood_florida_beaches_as_florida_reopens/fnxwb72/"}
