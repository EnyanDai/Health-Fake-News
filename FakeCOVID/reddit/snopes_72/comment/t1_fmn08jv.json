As of April 2, all major health organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) say that there is no evidence that a companion animal has transmitted the virus that causes COVID-19 to a person.", "created_utc": 1586215502.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmn08jv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fw8haa", "parent_id": "t3_fw8haa", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmn08jv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fw8haa/tigers_and_other_cats_can_catch_the_coronavirus/fmn08jv/"}
