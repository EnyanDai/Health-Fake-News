Even once?\n\nHas anyone you know? Nope is the answer 99.9% of the time.\n\nWhy is this? Because polls are done (usually) during weekdays from 10-5. Yep. Working hours. Okay, so your off today. You answer the phone, and they say something along the lines of HI this is is so & so from so & so can I have a few minutes of your time to ask you a few questions? Again 99.9% of the time most of us dont even let them finish that sentence. CLICK we hang up.\n\nSo, by and large, the only people who actually answer polls are either retirees just wanting someone to talk to or people who are too stupid to hang up. The lowest common denominator. So I'm not surprised 38% think corona beer has some affiliation with the coronavirus. I'd say at least 38% of people who actually go through with a solicitation call and answer a poll are simply...moronic.", "created_utc": 1582979349.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fj3d99x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fb0hca", "parent_id": "t1_fj1gfal", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2si6m", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fj3d99x", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/DeFranco/comments/fb0hca/the_spread_of_the_coronavirus_couldnt_have_come/fj3d99x/"}
