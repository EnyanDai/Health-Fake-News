Been in business since 2010. We were closed down 3/16 in my state by mandate due to being \u2018non-essential.\u2019 I was one of the first to apply for the CARES program, specifically the Paycheck Protection Program, but I also filed for a Economic Injury Disaster Loan. I know I was one of the first because I applied at the *second* the programs became available. Note that my revenue literally fell to zero after closure.\n\nI have been ghosted by both the SBA and my local bank in response to my filing. I call literally everyday to check the status. The response is always the same; don\u2019t worry...in progress. In the meantime, I have my employees asking me about the status of the loan is, as they cannot receive unemployment while they are still employed (even told them to try anyway... no luck). My landlords want to know what the hell is going on and I am trying to be as transparent as possible, but at some point, I expect they will be as desperate as I am and will want to collect.\n\nI expected this rollout to have its faults, and I know the situation itself is a first , but what-the-actual-fuck...\n\n- President dismissing the person responsible for monitoring the distribution of funds...\n\n- Hedge funds considering themselves \u2018small businesses\u2019 and dipping in the pot...\n\n- Real estate tycoons considering themselves \u2018small business\u2019 and dipping into the pot...\n\nNow I hear funds are exhausted. Got an email from my local bank about this reality, in fact. I am FUCKING SICK of this. I simply want to pay my employees, pay my landlords, and pay my bills. It is unfathomable that the leader of this country is getting out in front of the public and say all is well. Get your shit together! \n\nI fucking promise that I will not go down with this ship without taking those responsible down with me.
