This was a bill specifically crafted to help people deal with the Covid crisis.  But it's just now that Schumer is suggesting \"hey, maybe we should try and create a new bill that pays the underpaid people who are on the frontline of this crisis.\" It is so disingenuous and it's so clear where their priorities are. We all know Republicans do this shit in their sleep. It's their bread and butter and to be expected. But Democrats have made it an art form to line the pockets of the wealthy behind closed doors and then in public cry a river for the poor underclass.", "created_utc": 1587076667.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnmrb7a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2luoj", "parent_id": "t1_fnm9nib", "score": -8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnmrb7a", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/g2luoj/over_43000_us_millionaires_will_get_stimulus/fnmrb7a/"}
