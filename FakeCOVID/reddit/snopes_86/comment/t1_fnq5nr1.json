That's *anchoring* at work.\n\nOP said he/she \"never thought any of it was valid,\" but then watched this single video and, to paraphrase, 'discovered that there were many valid points.'\n\nWith only the included context, you could with reasonable certainty infer that OP never did any research on the subject at all beforehand, nor any research at all after.\n\nOP likely believes that \"there was something fishy about that whole situation\" and will, unless corrected with extreme prejudice, never change that position. Confirmation bias will see to that.\n\nOP is very likely not the sort of person who would fact check if something \"sounds valid\", which is exactly the sort of person manipulated by the various Youtube \"media outlets\" (I wish I could make scare quotes scarier somehow) and other purveyors of spurious claims, *especially* about things like Pizzagate and other conspiracy theories.\n\nFor these reasons, I don't think OP should ever get his or her news from Youtube.\n\nI don't think anyone should ever use it, or any documentary, as a *primary source*, let alone a *sole source.*\n\nIf one has, upon researching a topic, found a Youtube video that covers the basics well and accurately, I see no problem with promoting it, especially doing so *in addition* to good, primary sources. I don't believe anyone who has done so would ever say, 'watch this video it really opened my eyes.' Yes, I'm paraphrasing again.\n\nFurther, to use Youtube as a primary means of obtaining news or other information opens you up to the dangers of confirmation bias to a great extent. There is zero accountability, and misinformation abounds. Any responsible person should begin with a source that at least has a reputation for sanity, avoiding as much as possible both anchoring and confirmation bias.\n\nI no longer trust anyone to actually change their minds upon obtaining information that shows them to have been wrong.", "created_utc": 1587158147.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnq5nr1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2luoj", "parent_id": "t1_fnq113i", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnq5nr1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/g2luoj/over_43000_us_millionaires_will_get_stimulus/fnq5nr1/"}
