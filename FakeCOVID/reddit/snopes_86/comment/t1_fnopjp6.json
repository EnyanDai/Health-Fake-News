Easier to just making shit up.\n\nEither way let's go with your latest interpretation of yourself:\n\n>Those that are laid off are making more money than had they not and are make 2, 3, 4, 5x as much as I am off my tax dollars.\n\nBullshit again. There are tens of millions of people being laid off with wages across the board, unemployment benefits vary greatly by state, yet somehow you are telling me you know that they all make more now that they are laid off.\n\nFor example, max unemployment per week in Arizona is $240. Add the $600 you get $840/week which is less than median full-time weekly wages of $957/week. So you believe of the hundreds of thousands laid off in Arizona they were all earning well below median wages.
