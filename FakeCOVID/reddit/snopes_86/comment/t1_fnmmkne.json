And that\u2019s to basically break even and walk away without having lost money.\n\nThat\u2019s also assuming only federal income tax, no state tax. Some states tax lotto winnings and some don\u2019t.\n\nThe Powerball jackpot has never gone that high, to my knowledge. The highest Powerball ever was almost $1.6 billion. So still not even enough to make your money back if you guaranteed a win by buying every number combo with almost $600 million dollars.\n\nThat\u2019s also assuming nobody else gets a winning number and forces your pool to split the jackpot with them.\n\nIf you want to build in the risk of another winner, you\u2019d have to double everything, so the jackpot would have to be about $4 billion.\n\nSo yeah, there is no realistic way to guarantee a profit on the Powerball because the odds are too horrible and the jackpot never gets high enough to recoup the cost of buying almost $600 million worth of tickets.\n\nSo the long story short is, it wouldn\u2019t work.", "created_utc": 1587074153.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnmmkne", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2luoj", "parent_id": "t1_fnmk1mo", "score": 176, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 1, "edited": 1587074464.0, "name": "t1_fnmmkne", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/g2luoj/over_43000_us_millionaires_will_get_stimulus/fnmmkne/"}
