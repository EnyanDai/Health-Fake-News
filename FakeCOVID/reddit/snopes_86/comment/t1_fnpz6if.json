However ... \nSince legislators have no sort of line item veto, who authored something is functionally irrelevant.\nEven who actually voted for vs against a given piece of legislation is not even entirely relevant because a party will often calculate the minimum number of votes required to pass something and then give dispensation to their members to vote against something if that legislator is in political danger and the legislation is politically unpopular. So it is a constant game of chicken between individual legislators ( who want to stay in power ) and party leaders who want to keep donors happy ( and secondarily achieve political goals for the purpose of keeping voters happy ). So mitch mcconnell or some other demagogue from a totally safe district can have his techs \"commit\" the whole bill and the whole point of this is evaded. \n\nAs for tracing their backers, the vast majority of money in politics never goes through any organization that is controlled or tied to a particular candidate. From the national parties to all the superpacs. \"people for freedom\", \"the good stuff gang\" etc... \nUntil we have some mind bogglingly fundamental restructuring in the way government operates, something as clean or seemingly useful as technologically tracing individual language in a bill to a particular representative is science fiction. \n\n\nWay simpler things like public financing of elections and eliminating dark money and cleaning up and actually enforcing lobbying restrictions and regulatory capture via the revolving door in federal bureaucracy ( which are doable given the political will ) would solve a lot of things. There are clean democracies in the world, we should look at how they operate.", "created_utc": 1587154676.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnpz6if", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2luoj", "parent_id": "t1_fnp6suj", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnpz6if", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/g2luoj/over_43000_us_millionaires_will_get_stimulus/fnpz6if/"}
