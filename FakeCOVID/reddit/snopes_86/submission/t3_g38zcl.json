Some of them will benefit more than others, but either way it's a massive socialist bailout of the wealthiest Americans. Here's what make it even more incredible; a lot of these people cannot just sell there stocks on a whim like someone with a few thousand bucks in the market can (for a plethora of legal reasons) and would have had to pay taxes even if they were able to sell. Effectively they have propped up the market during the downturn and rebound, but anyone with a brain knows this is the beginning. Now they are going to sell with ZERO liability and tank the market and buy in near the bottom, exponentially increasing their wealth as the market recovers in the months and years to come.\n\n from [/u/dubious\\_diversion on Is it true that over 43,000 US millionaires will get \u2018stimulus\u2019 averaging $1.6 million each?](https://ift.tt/2KgfIoq)", "stickied": false}
