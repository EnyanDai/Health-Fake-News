The 43,000 millionaires are not all business owners, I don't know how many of them are, but I would suspect it's a minority of them. Furthermore, deducting a capital loss means you've sold your holdings. This will help some businesses remain solvent, which is great. It will also provide tremendous socialist relief to thousands of millionaires who are just parked in the market and have nothing to do with businesses with less than 500 employees.\n\nEffectively what they're being given (a massive tax relief) is far more valuable than cash. Why? Perpetual quantitative easing and incredibly low interest rates make cash less valuable.\n\nIf this was truly an egalitarian stimulus it would target a far smaller number of wealthy individuals. It is a bailout for the wealthy, with the caveat that it will help some businesses.\n\n from [/u/dubious\\_diversion on Is it true that over 43,000 US millionaires will get \u2018stimulus\u2019 averaging $1.6 million each?](https://ift.tt/2wNSYsB)", "stickied": false}
