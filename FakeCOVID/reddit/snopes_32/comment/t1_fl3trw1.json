Or are you being vague on purpose so you don't have to defend your position?\n\nI'm looking to talk about individuals not the nebulus \"fake news media\" which includes Trump himself (surely even you acknowledge he spreads a lot of fake news right?). \n\nWho calls being criticized a hoax? That's not how the word is generally used you must be aware of that right? If you're relying the base definition of any deception, literally every time anyone lies is technically a hoax. \n\nYou may disagree with criticism but calling it a hoax is pretty weak. \n\nAnd the fact is he never specified that only the democrat attacks on him were a hoax. While at the same time he factually downplayed the virus. Relying on nitpicking like if he specifically said \"the virus is a hoax\", is pretty deceptive...almost like a hoax.\n\nSo how do you feel about the Trump hoax that he called in a pandemic before anyone else did?", "created_utc": 1584798031.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl3trw1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fly2x9", "parent_id": "t1_fl34uds", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cr3o", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fl3trw1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fly2x9/what_is_your_opinion_of_the_coronavirus_video/fl3trw1/"}
