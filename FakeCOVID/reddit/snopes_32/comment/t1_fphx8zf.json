Aside from the constant bs that goes both ways causing us to get nothing done and the facts their organizations are the least efficient.

We have handled this well but we have also been in quarantine for too long. Not bc I need a hair cut but bc there\u2019s a rather low death rate for those of us who are healthy. We should be able to get back to work and provide for our families bc the government does a shit job at that, another state level aspect.", "created_utc": 1588629496.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fphx8zf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gbqfdt", "parent_id": "t1_fphwb3b", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3oh4c", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fphx8zf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TheLeftCantMeme/comments/gbqfdt/by_the_way_snopes_refuted_the_accusation_that/fphx8zf/"}
