Right now the death rate is at about .2-.3% from the virus.  The average age of the people who have died from the virus is over 80.  And, to have a significant chance of death, you have to be over 50 (really 60, but I'll give it to you).  We are not stopping anyone from getting the virus.  We are not preventing anyone from having complications from the virus.  We are only slowing the spread.  There are three antibody studies done, two in California one in New York, that say the infection rate is 50 to 70 times higher than reported.  Meaning, if those numbers hold up, the death rate is far less than the flu.  We know that multiple states have over reported deaths due to the virus.  The worst being NY.  They had to take away thousands of cases.  And we know that Cuomo ordered nursing homes to take positive people.  That drove the death rate up is his state by thousands.\n\nKnowing all of that, we should be reopened right now.  We can have the same result we have now by quarantining people over 70.  There is no science that is behind our actions.  We have been fed fear and panic for so long that we cannot see the facts, anymore.  Wash your hands-great idea.  Social distance-good idea.  Wear a mask-only if you are sick or near a vulnerable person.  Remember that about 60% of what you exhale goes around the mask.", "created_utc": 1588713982.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpljsyd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t1_fpkhi50", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpljsyd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fpljsyd/"}
