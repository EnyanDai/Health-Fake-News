I think my biggest sticking point so far has him seemingly and willfully ignoring that we were on a different timeline compared to other countries and playing down the numbers for a few weeks. The comment about going \"from 15 to 0\" really sticks out to me. That, along with comparing this to the flu which seems to have really enabled people to be absolute shitheads right now.\n\nI personally think that, even though those stories you pointed out are probably mostly false, he still has failed in his response. He should've seen countries were running out of PPE equipment (SK/China/Italy) and enacted DPA long before right now. He should've had a stronger hand in guiding states for quarantines (like half the states still don't have mandatory quarantines iirc). He shouldn't be worrying about China taking potshots at him (it seriously is not the time to try and politicize the name of the virus...cmon).\n\nThose are my main gripes, do you agree with that at least?", "created_utc": 1584770527.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl36hkr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fly2x9", "parent_id": "t1_fl2oj4k", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cr3o", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fl36hkr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fly2x9/what_is_your_opinion_of_the_coronavirus_video/fl36hkr/"}
