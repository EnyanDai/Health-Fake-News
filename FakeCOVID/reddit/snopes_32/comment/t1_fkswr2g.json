I have a group of gaming friends and we all have the same values and wants and things and out of nowhere we\u2019re talking about politics and one guy admits he\u2019s a trump supporter. It blew me away and changed my whole perspective of my friend. My friend felt like he was saving money with less taxes and that was why he supported Trump. \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve just made it a rule not to talk politics with anyone because you never know and it will change the view of someone you thought was a good person before. If you find out they\u2019re a trump supporter you immediately think of them in a negative light.", "created_utc": 1584500214.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkswr2g", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka5wb", "parent_id": "t1_fksd3he", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkswr2g", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka5wb/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fkswr2g/"}
