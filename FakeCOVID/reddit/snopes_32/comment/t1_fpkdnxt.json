It was probably more contagious for those local, but since the disease spread by blood and sweat at later stages and the symptoms were more severe and acute than compared to covid-19 it was easier to trace. Norway did nothing to avoid spread of Ebola and it wasn\u2019t something we even worried about. \n\nCovid-19 many people are even asymptotic and spread the virus early before they get symptoms, which they don\u2019t necessarily do. And the death rate is lower than Ebola so more people move around with it. Ironically if covid-19 had been more deadly it might have been easier to contain in China than a less deadly version as the early carriers would be cut off faster from society.", "created_utc": 1588692781.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpkdnxt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t1_fpka2r9", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpkdnxt", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fpkdnxt/"}
