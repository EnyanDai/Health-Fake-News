His absolution coming from men and women who supported him out of fear, greed, selfish ambition, or simply lack of strength of Will.\n\nOUR Representatives have Failed US.  All these endless Polls and Pundits be damned.   \n\nWe need to stop looking at polls and look the truth in the eye.\n\nWe all know this simplest of Truths:  The man we as a Nation put into power is certainly not the man that can continue to lead our Nation by any sane measure or tracts of logic.  \n\nSo I have to ask:  Just what are WE waiting for ?", "created_utc": 1588645636.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpip5q4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t1_fpgpmb3", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpip5q4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fpip5q4/"}
