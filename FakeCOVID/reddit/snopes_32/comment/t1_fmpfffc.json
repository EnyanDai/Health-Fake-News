Are you really trying to blame Obama for anything happening now?! 3 years he has been in office and this problem was due to he (Trump) not taking action and worrying about his pill numbers. Not letting a ship dock. Canceling the pandemic group for the white house that deals with this shit. If you really think he isn't at fault then your the problem as well. Did Obama screw up as well fuck yes but that does not give Trump an out. To err is human to forgive divine. I would forgive Trump if he came out and just fucking said he was sorry. And that he knows he fucked up. Looks I voted for the guy in 2016. I have been a republican my whole life. This is a hard time for everyone. No parties just lives being lost and a world being pushed into darkness.
