Especially so with the line of \"this is their new hoax\", followed by saying essentially 'oh there's only 15 cases, it's no biggie'.\n\nHe then said the media was in hysteria mode and used flu numbers to back it up.\n\nSo honestly, I don't think this post fits here. The person apologized, trump's comments, response to criticism, lack of action, and more can absolutely be interpreted as him thinking it's a hoax, even in the full context. Hell, he has mike fucking pence running the coronavirus task force, a medical layman who is also a science denier who thought smoking didn't cause cancer and had an aids epidemic under his leadership, and I wouldn't doubt mike thought corona was a fake illness for a while.", "created_utc": 1585070512.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fldrwkr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fnv8fy", "parent_id": "t1_flbp5k3", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3a6w2", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585073390.0, "name": "t1_fldrwkr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/media_criticism/comments/fnv8fy/washington_post_reporter_has_apologized_for_and/fldrwkr/"}
