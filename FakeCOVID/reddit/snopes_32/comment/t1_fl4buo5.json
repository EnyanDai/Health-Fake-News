Very little can outright stop the spread of a pandemic. Really nothing realistically can be done by the leader of one country to *stop* the spread of a pandemic originating in another country, especially when that other country is a lying commie shit hole suppressing its own doctors and journalists.\n\nEven so, trump was still ahead of the curve and his contemporaries. If more leaders had made the same decision he had it would have slowed the pandemic much more.\n\nTrump was issuing travel bans, quarantines and screens by the beginning of february, before there were even any deaths outside of China.", "created_utc": 1584810247.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl4buo5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fly2x9", "parent_id": "t1_fl3xuf4", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cr3o", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fl4buo5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fly2x9/what_is_your_opinion_of_the_coronavirus_video/fl4buo5/"}
