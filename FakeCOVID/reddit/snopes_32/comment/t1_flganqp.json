He secretly loves SS in his heart but has been out to cut it for years then? What false comfort do you have to spin for yourself here?\n\nOr he thinks it's a worthwhile program but also, for years, was willing to cut it's benefits.\n\nI think Joe Biden is a centrist at best, more likely center-right.\n\nBut again, I don't have to lie about him to make my arguments agaisnt him.\n\nNow, if Joe Biden openly said \"I hate SS\" \"I think SS is a bad program and should be abolished\" you might have a point. Or even if he acted in a way tht demonstrated that (ie pushed for SS to be abolished).\n\nBut guess what? None of things ever happened.\n\nModest cuts to SS during a budget crisis =/= hating social security.\n\nYou're an idiot for saying it, even more for believing it.\n\n>Also how scary is it that was the only thing you were even capable of making an argument against.\n\nThats a pretty big assumption there, don't you think?
