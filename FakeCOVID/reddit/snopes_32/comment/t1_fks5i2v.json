It was already very apparent that Trump was a habitual liar, often in the service of projection, but I didn't quite expect that he would so closely embody the caricature of another man I invented. He even uses the same punchline my imaginary sketch character does: \"[you're/they're] lying.\"", "created_utc": 1584482703.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fks5i2v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka5wb", "parent_id": "t3_fka5wb", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fks5i2v", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka5wb/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fks5i2v/"}
