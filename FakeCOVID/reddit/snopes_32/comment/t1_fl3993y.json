I don't see any instance of anyone above you in this tread argue that Trump claimed the virus itself is a hoax. That is not what I have an issue with. My issue, first of all, is I don't think the criticism of Trump from the left is a hoax at all. Pretty much every thing I have seen has been sincere and legitimate. The left truly thinks Trump has seriously mismanaged the response to the virus and also that he left us unprepared to deal with a pandemic as a result of some of his administration's actions. I could kind of understand if Trump and his supporters denied mismanaging the crisis, but to say that the Democrats are just making up things to criticize Trump about, not because they believe it, but to hurt Trumps reelection just doesn't make sense?", "created_utc": 1584773599.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl3993y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fly2x9", "parent_id": "t1_fl26c70", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cr3o", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fl3993y", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fly2x9/what_is_your_opinion_of_the_coronavirus_video/fl3993y/"}
