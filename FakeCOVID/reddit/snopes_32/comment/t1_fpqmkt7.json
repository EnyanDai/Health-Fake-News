He did next to nothing until Tucker Carlson aired a show talking about how this was a big deal.

The virus was already out of China and it didn't even prevent all traffic from China anyway.\n\nThis administration sat on it's hands for the first 2 months of this year trying to pretend, and actively proclaiming that this was all going to blow over. That messaging and everything we've seen come from the administration gives every indication that they let themselves get caught flat footed on this.
