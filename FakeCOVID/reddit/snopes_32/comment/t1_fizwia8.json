Under Pence, Indiana suffered its worst spike in HIV.  He laid the groundwork by gutting public health programs that provided HIV testing in poverty stricken counties, then after praying on it and having Mother read him some bible verses, he refused to allow needle exchange programs because he believed it promoted drug use.  The result in Scott County alone was 20 new HIV cases a week.  200 people became infected in a 4 month period while Indiana struggled to get their arms around the outbreak.  Pence finally caved and allowed several needle exchange programs to open on a temporary basis.  \n\nHIV is a notoriously expensive disease to treat, but easily preventable.  Pence's home state suffered because of his moral stance, a flat out refusal to take the advice of public health professionals.   \n\nThis is the guy Trump selects to prevent a coronavirus epidemic in the US.\n\nEdit: its not it's", "created_utc": 1582877727.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fizwia8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fanm5m", "parent_id": "t1_fizl3vf", "score": 32, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3ee9f", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1582920974.0, "name": "t1_fizwia8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/trumptweets/comments/fanm5m/president_trump_do_nothing_democrats_were_busy/fizwia8/"}
