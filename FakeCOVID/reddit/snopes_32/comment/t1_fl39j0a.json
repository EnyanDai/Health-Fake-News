That info is not hard to find at all. Agree, the virus is not airborne, but it CAN form aresol droplets in the right circumstances and can even stay suspended in the air for up to 3 hours. For the most part, the virus is effected by the force of gravity, so after a sneeze of a cough the particles fall directly to the ground.\n\nTrump's pressers are aweful. Have you ever noticed hos his syncopes talk more than the health experts. I feel like the reason Trump is spending so much time doing them is not for the public good, but that he is desperate for being praised and fawned over. He cant do his ralleys so he has switched to the presser. If it was really about the public good he would speak for about 5 min and then let the health experts have the rest of the time?", "created_utc": 1584773920.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl39j0a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fly2x9", "parent_id": "t1_fl3566f", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cr3o", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fl39j0a", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fly2x9/what_is_your_opinion_of_the_coronavirus_video/fl39j0a/"}
