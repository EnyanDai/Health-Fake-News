You just say that he\u2019s smarter than he seems, that all people have biases (duh), and a bunch of other platitudes.\n\nWouldn\u2019t he *have* to be smarter than he seems? I mean, for basic human functioning, he would have to be. Regardless, being \u201csmarter than he seems\u201d isn\u2019t a ringing endorsement of his presidential fitness. His main accomplishment has been leveraging his massive inheritance into crafting an \u201cAmerican tycoon\u201d character that he has performed consistently for decades. I think he understands the power of media very well. I think he knows how to tell people what they want to hear. Combined with zero compunction about lying, he\u2019s got a a great recipe for doing whatever the fuck he wants. This does not make him an effective president\u2014it makes him an effective criminal.", "created_utc": 1584633083.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkxpu14", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka1ke", "parent_id": "t1_fkvh6b7", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkxpu14", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka1ke/trump_who_has_previously_called_the_coronavirus_a/fkxpu14/"}
