At no time did he call the Virus a Hoax.  In context, Trump did not say in the passage above that the virus itself was a hoax. He instead said that Democrats\u2019 criticism of his administration\u2019s response to it was a hoax. And by posting this shitty Newsweak article, you are propagating the hoax. **Congratulations! You played right into what Donald Trump said! \"The media is Fake News\"!!**\n\n\"One of my people came up to me and said, \u2018Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they\u2019ve been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning, they lost, it\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. **And this is their new hoax.** But you know, we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We\u2019re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\"\n\n\n**But whatever. Continue to spread your fake news. This is why you lost in 2016 and this is why you will lose in 2020.**", "created_utc": 1584546172.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkube3o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fknh9x", "parent_id": "t3_fknh9x", "score": -2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9a", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkube3o", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldpolitics/comments/fknh9x/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fkube3o/"}
