Like ignorant stupid hillbillys basically. A stereotype. \n\nThey legitimately only believe Trump and everything he says. Anything negative that comes out about him they just don't believe. Fake news they call it.\n\nBut Trumps legitimately fake news they treat as gospel. So they will legit believe Trump that he knew this was a pandemic.\n\nSo in effect if they hear something that doesn't sound good about their dear leader they just don't believe it. They only buy into his crazy nonsense. Their whole worldview is extremely warped. \n\nIts frightening really. Scary how stupid people are. How can we progress as a society when you have so many genuinely stupid people? Sheep. These people should be embarrassed. Like actually humiliated embarrassed they got so duped by a con artist. However its the exact opposite. They are loud and proud of their ignorance. It makes no sense. I hate to say it but if Trump and his cult like supporters just disappeared off the face of the earth wed all be better off as a species.", "created_utc": 1584505534.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkt3w9f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka5wb", "parent_id": "t3_fka5wb", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584505789.0, "name": "t1_fkt3w9f", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka5wb/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fkt3w9f/"}
