Oh, you have the virus? It must have caused the heart attack.\n\nOr if you have other co-morbidities like like the diabetes, or high blood pressure, asthma, etc.\n\nInstead of being marked as a death WITH the virus, these people are getting marked as deaths FROM the virus. And part of this may have to do with hospitals getting more money from the Federal government for Wuhan Virus deaths or so the patient doesn't have to pay for treatment.\n\n\nThere's good evidence now that the virus doesn't affect children, barely affects teens, slightly more young to middle aged adults, and mostly old people.\n\nInstead of quarantining people who are healthy (or appear to be so), why not now quarantine the elderly or more vulnerable populations? Or maybe pay them to stay home if they want/need to?\n\nI'd much rather the immunocompromised and elderly get more from the stimulus money if it meant the rest of us could go about our lives almost like normal.", "created_utc": 1588428839.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fp9l0c8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gbqfdt", "parent_id": "t1_fp8wkcu", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3oh4c", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fp9l0c8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TheLeftCantMeme/comments/gbqfdt/by_the_way_snopes_refuted_the_accusation_that/fp9l0c8/"}
