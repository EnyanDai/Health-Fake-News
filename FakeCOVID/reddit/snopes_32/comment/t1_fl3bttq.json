But that's exactly what he meant because I remember him saying that I have debunked this point before.\n\nFeel free to provide the context of what he said in his words that prove otherwise. You won't be able to.\n\n>Do you find that you usually have to work hard to find out the true intent of Trumps words? Or are the rest of us just stupid for misconstruing everything?\n\nNot at all. And you're just pointing this out because the fake news media brought this up as an example of his lying or contradictions or whatever. No normal American heard him saying that and was concerned about the meaning. It's the fake news media writing these stupid articles and then other people hear them and repeat them without even reading the details.  \nNot only do they not read the article themselves which are full of lies but occasionally provide the full context. Not only do they just repeat the headlines or repeat other peoples repetition of the headlines. But they rarely read the articles. And rarely go to the full context of Donald Trump's actual words.
