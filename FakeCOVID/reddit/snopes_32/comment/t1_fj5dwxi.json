As for the proposed budget cuts, they do meed to happen, but not because we need to defund the CDC or anything. It's because there is so much redundancy in government. There are 15 differwnt organizations doing thebsame things, and all it does is actually decrease the government's ability to do anything, and wastes a ridiculous amount of money. And before you say anything, what is the debt up to? More importantly, what is our debt in tegards to unfunded liabilites? Put those numbers together, and if you don't think we have a MASSIVE problem, and it isn't the people who saddled us with it that will be ruined. This shit on both sides has almost certainly ensured that our children and grandchildren will have nothing. And how am I wrong, by the way? I never said that there wasn't proposed spending cuts tabled. I just said that it is an absolute lie that the CDC and NHSC have had their funding slashed.", "created_utc": 1583030356.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fj5dwxi", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fbfemw", "parent_id": "t1_fj59d1e", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj2e", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fj5dwxi", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conservatives/comments/fbfemw/media_claims_trump_called_coronavirus_a_hoax/fj5dwxi/"}
