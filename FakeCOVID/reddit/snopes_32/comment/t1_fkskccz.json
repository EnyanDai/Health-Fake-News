Which is obviously what happened anyway. \n\nLike I said I don\u2019t like the man, but I don\u2019t think he fucked up because he\u2019s a monster, he just fucked up doing his best to keep people calm. \n\nI think most other people would have gone differently. Like \u201cHey, shit is fucked up yo! But we gotta focus and stay calm, it ain\u2019t the apocalypse. We have to do our best to not spread this bullshit and find ways to mitigate the shit.\u201d\n\nWe need \u201cPresident Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\u201d and \u201cNot Sure\u201d to figure this shit out. \n\nI think President Obama would have done a better job, but stuff is all fucked up, no one can do shit about it no matter how good they are. \n\nThis is unprecedented. There is no book on how to deal with an epidemic like this. Even experts that study this stuff know that there isn\u2019t much you can do but try and keep the transmission of the illness as low as possible. Some are saying 70% of us will get it. There just is no stopping it, only maybe slowing it down if drastic measures are taken. \n\nEvery other country has been butt banged by Covid 19, why would the USA be immune? All those leaders suck ass too?
