You know that, right? Coronavirus. They're politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs, you say, 'How's President Trump doing?', 'Oh, nothing, nothing.' They have no clue, they don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa, they can't even count. No, they can't. They can't count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, 'Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.' That didn't work out too well. They couldn't do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they've been doing it since he got in. It's all turning, they lost. It's all turning, think of it, think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that's been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\"\n\nFrom what I see, it looks like what he is referring to as the hoax is that the virus is going to get bad. At the end he is trying to downplay it since there where only 15 people infected at the time. That is in line with his not taking the virus seriously and even attempting to get the country back up and running sooner than it should despite warnings by the health experts. That is, until he finally saw the body bags getting loaded into the refrigerator trucks this week and could no longer downplay it.", "created_utc": 1585712952.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm34wgu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fsru23", "parent_id": "t3_fsru23", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm34wgu", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fsru23/no_trump_never_called_coronavirus_a_hoax/fm34wgu/"}
