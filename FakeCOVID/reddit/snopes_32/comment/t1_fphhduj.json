There are hundreds of quotes saying this.  \n  \nI didn't repeat anything verbatim.\n\n> They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they\u2019ve been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning, they lost, it\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We\u2019re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.    \n  \nThat's the quote.  He's downplaying both the virus' effect and the criticism of his admin's response a hoax.  The effect of the virus' is the entire issue.  He doesn't get it both ways.  Either the virus and it's severity is a hoax and the criticism is valid or it's not.  They are all linked together.  \n  \nHe doesn't need to say it specifically for that to be his entire point.
