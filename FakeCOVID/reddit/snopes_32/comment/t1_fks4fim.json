Or that he lies/fibs to make his message more appealing. I think we would both agree that trumps tactic is to sell a message to promote trust/belief in that message so it actually becomes reality.\n\nIt is a valid strategy if it works, and I would argue it has worked well for him so far but it's not an impervious strategy.\n\nI would also agree trump is downplaying the coronavirus in an attempt to keep the US economy working as long as it can before he has to pull an emergency cord. So that when the economy does start back up, we are in a better position than worse. \n\nIn my opinion, how it plays out when the economy does start back up will be a major decider in trump's base having faith in him going into the election.", "created_utc": 1584482064.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fks4fim", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka5wb", "parent_id": "t1_fkrw7ku", "score": -3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fks4fim", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka5wb/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fks4fim/"}
