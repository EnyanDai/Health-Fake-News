You can't fight a pandemic with one measure alone, and what's productive in one phase of a pandemic might be counter-productive during a different phase.\n\nTravel bans have an important role in a pandemic, yes.\n\nFighting a pandemic only by issuing travel bans in not going to work, no.\n\n>Really nothing realistically can be done by the leader of one country to stop the spread of a pandemic originating in another country, especially when that other country is a lying commie shit hole suppressing its own doctors and journalists.\n\nThere are worlds of difference between a futile attempt to stop a pandemic and being prepared for a pandemic in the best possible way.\n\nWasting time, being unable to get testing capacities up, not having enough emergency supplies, implementing additional measures too late, lacking clear communications about the current state of the pandemic and what to do - all of those are things that will cost people's lives.\n\n>Even so, trump was still ahead of the curve and his contemporaries.\n\nGermany was trialing a test at the beginning of January, and was starting mass production of test kits by mid-January. South Korea was aggressively tracing infection chains, and putting people in isolation.
