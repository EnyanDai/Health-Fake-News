They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early, we could have had a lot more than that. We\u2019re doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified. We are so unified. The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now. There has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now. Never been a movement. So a statistic that we want to talk about, go ahead. Say USA. It\u2019s okay. USA. So a number that nobody heard of, that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? 35,000, that\u2019s a lot of people. It could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000.\n\nIt goes on. \n\nAre you seriously suggesting you know exactly what he was referring to when he said \"And this is their new hoax\"?\n\nYou can dig out a context in that? As much as I like snopes, I don't think they can definitively say what Trump meant.\n\nAnd I'm sick of his supporters reinterpreting for him. No. I'm happy for this to be interpreted as him calling the outbreak a hoax. Say whatever you want to me. Don't care any more. It's not like his sycophants argue in good faith.", "created_utc": 1584535694.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fktvdvv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fknh9x", "parent_id": "t1_fktufmo", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9a", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fktvdvv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldpolitics/comments/fknh9x/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fktvdvv/"}
