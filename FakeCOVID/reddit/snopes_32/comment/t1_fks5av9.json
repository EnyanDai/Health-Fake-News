It\u2019s one person coming in from China. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d\n\nFebruary 2: \u201cWell, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China. \u2026 We can\u2019t have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus. So we\u2019re gonna see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes.\u201d\n\nFebruary 14: \u201cWe have a very small number of people in the country, right now, with it. It\u2019s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we\u2019re in very good shape.\u201d\n\nFebruary 24: \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u2026 Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d\n\nFebruary 25: \u201cCDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.\u201d\n\nFebruary 25: \u201cI think that's a problem that\u2019s going to go away\u2026 They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we\u2019re very close to a vaccine.\u201d\n\nFebruary 26: \u201cThe 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.\u201d\n\nFebruary 26: \u201cWe're going very substantially down, not up.\u201d\n\nFebruary 27: \u201cOne day it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201d\n\nFebruary 28: \u201cWe're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.\u201d\n\nFebruary 28: \u201cNow the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019 They go, \u2018Oh, not good, not good.\u2019 They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa.\u201d \u201cThey tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.\u201d\n\nMarch 2: \u201cYou take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?\u201d\n\nMarch 2: \u201cA lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they\u2019re happening very rapidly.\u201d\n\nMarch 4: \u201cIf we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work \u2014 some of them go to work, but they get better.\u201d\n\nMarch 5: \u201cI NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.\u201d\n\nMarch 5: \u201cThe United States\u2026 has, as of now, only 129 cases\u2026 and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!\u201d\n\nMarch 6: \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down\u2026 a tremendous job at keeping it down.\u201d\n\nMarch 6: \u201cAnybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They\u2019re there. And the tests are beautiful\u2026. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.\u201d\n\nMarch 6: \"You know, my uncle was a great person. He was at MIT. He taught at MIT for, I think, like a record number of years. He was a great super genius. Dr. John Trump. I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, 'How do you know so much about this? ' Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.\"\n\nMarch 6: \u201cI don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.\u201d\n\nMarch 8: \u201cWe have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.\u201d\n\nMarch 9: \u201cThis blindsided the world.\u201d\n\nMarch 9: \"The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant.\u201d\n\nMarch 9: \u201cSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!\u201d\n\nMarch 10: \"It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\"\n\nMarch 11: \"This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.\"\n\nMarch 13: \"Today I am officially declaring a national emergency. Two very big words.\"\n\nMarch 13: \u201cI don't take responsibility at all\u201d\n\nMarch 13: \"For decades the u/CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. **President Obama made changes that only complicated things further**\"\n\nMarch 14: \"SOCIAL DISTANCING!\"\n\nMarch 15: \"TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\"\n\nMarch 15: \u201cThis is a very contagious virus. It\u2019s incredible. But it\u2019s something that we have tremendous control over.\u201d\n\nMarch 16: \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the virus, no, that\u2019s not under control for any place in the world. ... I was talking about what we\u2019re doing is under control, but I\u2019m not talking about the virus.\"\n\nMarch 16: \"I'd rate it a 10\" (in response to how he rate his handling of the situation)", "created_utc": 1584482580.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fks5av9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fkcwca", "parent_id": "t1_fks560i", "score": 12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fks5av9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fkcwca/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fks5av9/"}
