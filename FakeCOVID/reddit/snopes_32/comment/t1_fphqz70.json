They are bad. We can sit back and relax today, there's no way we'll lose\". So all of the players say, ok cool, we're all good guys, no need to practice, no need to do drills, we can relax. And then their team gets absolutely destroyed because they didn't prepare. Do you think the Coach is justified in saying \"Hey, why are you blaming me? Everyone dropped the ball. We all messed up. I don't take responsibility for our loss\". Doesn't that sound ridiculous? It's the Coach's JOB to figure out what needs to be done, and make sure the members of their team are focusing on those things. \n\nIt's Trump's JOB to know what's going on, and to inform the rest of the country. And he has 1000x the resources that any local official does to be able to evaluate the right course of action, and 1000x the influence to get local officials to recognize the threat. I can't believe that anyone could defend the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES because other people, most relying on information from him and his Administration, also made mistakes.", "created_utc": 1588626196.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fphqz70", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t1_fphprnt", "score": 16, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1588627052.0, "name": "t1_fphqz70", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fphqz70/"}
