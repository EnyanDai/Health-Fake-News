I'd be against anyone being tokenized to an identity of only being a woman or being a certain race or being a certain religion just for political capital/clout.\n\nEdit: yeah, the thought of Obama being like \"don't worry guys, I'll pick a white guy as my vp\" sounds equally scummy", "created_utc": 1584488757.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fksf9t3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka1ke", "parent_id": "t1_fkseohk", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584489076.0, "name": "t1_fksf9t3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka1ke/trump_who_has_previously_called_the_coronavirus_a/fksf9t3/"}
