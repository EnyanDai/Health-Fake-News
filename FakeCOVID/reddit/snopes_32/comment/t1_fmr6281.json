He was amongst their biggest donors before he flirted/ran in the GOP around 2012.

Americans with truly free choice means a purification of the republic. You and I work to subsidize the development of countries and people that hate us on a fundamental level. If given the power, Iran, China, Venezuela, Palestine, Iraq, Libya, Syria, North Korea, Etc would kill us without a second thought.
