Do you admit there are no statements that Trump made earlier on that demonstrate he was taking things seriously? Care to \u201ccherry pick\u201d your own statements he made to prove that wrong? Care to reply to any of my specific questions in previous posts? Happy to talk about actions and results rather than his (frankly utterly mind-boggling) statements if you rather do that - Did his \u201cactions\u201d including getting on top of making sure a vaccine was being developed (and if so how do you explain the glaring and frankly incomprehensible ignorance he displayed in the *March 2* (long after he says he knew the extent of this problem) meeting with pharma execs?) Did his \u201cactions\u201d include continuing to hold rallies *after* he claims he knew about the severity of this problem? Did his *actions* result in enough tests, PPE, and ventilators for hospitals? Did his \u201cactions\u201d involve encouraging social distancing early on? Don\u2019t you think taking effective \u201caction\u201d early on was important, and that there is demonstrable evidence that he didn\u2019t do that? (Again, see e.g., the *entire* televised meeting on March 2 which *clearly* demonstrates that he had no idea what we were dealing with even at that point)? Do you think \u201cI\u2019ll ban travel from a small section of China and call it a day\u201d was a good strategy? How has that worked out, huh? Was he correct when he *repeatedly* assured the American public that he had this all under control? Bonus question: in the end, how many millions of Americans do you think will die because of the utter incompetence of this president? Extra bonus question: why do you always ignore difficult questions and just keep repeating (often already proven false) statements that fit your narrative? Are you trying to avoid cognitive dissonance?", "created_utc": 1584765241.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl30t7j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fly2x9", "parent_id": "t1_fl195tn", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cr3o", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fl30t7j", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fly2x9/what_is_your_opinion_of_the_coronavirus_video/fl30t7j/"}
