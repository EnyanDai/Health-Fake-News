Which is the point.\n\nNope, it was pretty clear he took it seriously with his China travel ban and no that wasn't the point. OP said \"he explicitly says the virus is a hoax by the democrats at one of his rallies\" which is a flat out lie repeated by democrats, even snopes says that's false and if you can read and comprehend it's clear he never said that.\n\n>The US is on track to be the most cases and deaths and this man was calling the impact this virus would have a democratic hit job. \n\nI highly doubt the US is on track to have the most deaths compared to the Europe nations. Just Italy, Spain, France, UK combined are almost at 50k deaths.  USA has 330 million people btw. \n\n>and this man was calling the impact this virus would have a democratic hit job.\n\nSource?", "created_utc": 1586324694.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmrj1ar", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwylj1", "parent_id": "t1_fmrho48", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmrj1ar", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fwylj1/nbc_still_pushing_fake_news_that_trump_called/fmrj1ar/"}
