It\u2019s all turning, they lost, it\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We\u2019re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\" There's the quote. \n\n\nNow let's look at the definition of the word hoax. \"A humorous or malicious deception\". If Trump's words aren't calling the virus a malicious deception, then your fucking lying to yourself. So sure.. he didn't say the word hoax, but he, inarguably, tried to convince Americans it wasn't a threat but saying everything happening was malicious deception by fellow americans... Which is the exact definition of hoax. \n\n\nThis is why people don't take repubs seriously. Right here. Because to his supporters, somehow him not saying the word hoax negates the fact that he said incredibly irresponsible, stupid, dangerous things. And he's done it repeatedly for months now. It's not about the exact word hoax here, it's about the obvious obvious obvious message he was trying to push. Covid is no big deal. If you read his quote and get anything other than that, then again, you are lying to yourself.", "created_utc": 1588631897.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpi1n4c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t1_fpgy27q", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpi1n4c", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fpi1n4c/"}
