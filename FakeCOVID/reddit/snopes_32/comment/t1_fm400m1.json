The following includes a link to the full unedited speech on NPR's YouTube channel, with excerpts transcribed. Feel free to use this:\n\n---\n\n\nTrump said the word hoax 3 times during that rally (Charleston, South Carolina Rally \u2013 February 28, 2020) that was referred to.

Coronavirus, they\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u201cHow\u2019s President Trump doing?\u201d They go, \u201cOh, not good, not good.\u201d They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa. They can\u2019t even count. No, they can\u2019t.

They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment ***hoax***. \n\n> That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new ***hoax***.\n\n> But we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early, we could have had a lot more than that. \n\n15 people referring to, at the time, number of cases in the US.\n\nThen again later:\n\n> If you think over [inaudible 00:22:07. While the extreme left has been wasting America\u2019s time with these vile ***hoax***es, we\u2019ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, and lifting up citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.", "created_utc": 1585742769.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm400m1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fsru23", "parent_id": "t1_fm3i7a9", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm400m1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fsru23/no_trump_never_called_coronavirus_a_hoax/fm400m1/"}
