The headline makes its noun \"coronavirus\". Fine. Then the headline says Trump called \"it\" a hoax. That means through grammar Trump called the coronavirus a hoax. Not true. His hoax stuff was clearly about the response. \n\nThat's the definition of a misleading headline. I won't stand for it. If you keep running headlines saying a president did something he didn't, then its not news its political conspiracy theory bs. \n\nThus the headline is trash because its describing something that didn't happen. If you were in journalism school and wrote that your teacher would fail you. Integrity matters.  All out a trash headline and then go into your political take.", "created_utc": 1588696761.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpklebv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t1_fpkkt4l", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpklebv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fpklebv/"}
