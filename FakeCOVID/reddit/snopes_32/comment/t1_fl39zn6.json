That info is not hard to find at all. Agree, the virus is not airborne, but it CAN form aresol droplets in the right circumstances and can even stay suspended in the air for up to 3 hours. For the most part, the virus is effected by the force of gravity, so after a sneeze of a cough the particles fall directly to the ground.\n\nSo you're unaware of the context of why I was saying the virus does not travel more than 6 feet etc. Because I don't understand why you're telling me this if you are aware of the context. Please review the context.\n\n>trump's pressers are aweful. Have you ever noticed hos his syncopes talk more than the health experts. I feel like the reason Trump is spending so much time doing them is not for the public good, but that he is desperate for being praised and fawned over. He cant do his ralleys so he has switched to the presser. If it was really about the public good he would speak for about 5 min and then let the health experts have the rest of the time?\n\nThat's an interesting position. What's your evidence? Who should talk more and on what basis? Is there a ratio of how much the health expert should talk? And what are they not saying that you haven't been hearing because of this? Is there a reason you think they need to talk more? What are you not hearing which makes you say this?\n\nYou feel like that about Donald Trump. I know you do. And I know most liberals do. And your feelings are wrong. Now let's discuss the evidence for your feelings. Because feelings are not tools of cognition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems like the journalist rather hear from him. That's my feeling.
