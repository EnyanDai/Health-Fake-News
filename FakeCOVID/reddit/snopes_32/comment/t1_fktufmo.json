There are plenty of options to choose from. Hell, you can still criticize him for the same speech. Just be factual. \"Trump's lackluster response to Covid is a disgrace, as is his lying about his shitty response.\" \n\nThat way the conversation would be about, you know, the truth. Rather than the discussion we're currently having about what the truth is. We could have been focusing on why he lied about how shitty his response is and I would have been curious to know what the right wing reply would be. Instead we get the insanely predictable responses, \"That's not what he said, you're spreading fake news.\" Which isn't even wrong in this particular case. \n\nLike, you read this part right?\n\n>President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him,\n\nYou read the part directly after. Ignored the part that proved what you're saying is wrong.", "created_utc": 1584534906.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fktufmo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fknh9x", "parent_id": "t1_fkttbm1", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9a", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fktufmo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldpolitics/comments/fknh9x/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fktufmo/"}
