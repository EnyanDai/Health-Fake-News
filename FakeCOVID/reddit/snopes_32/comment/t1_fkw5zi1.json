He basically does call it a hoax and he uses the term \"Democrat hoax\" which has 2 different meanings but both of them are not real.   \n\nWhat  has resonated the most is Trumps pretense that he has taken measures to stop the Coronavirus, which he had not done, and that somehow no one is recognizing this.\n\nThis is an actual tweet by the president on February 24th, not something made up by a news organization:\n\n*\"The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\"*\n\nIt was posted on this sub.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/fklq2i/02242020_trump_the_coronavirus_is_very_much_under/\n\nIn addition, Trump  has made brags that he had the virus under control (2/28) and the Trump WH has made statements to the effect that \"the media\" are exaggerating the effect of the coronavirus (2/28) and that the virus did not hit inside the US specifically because of actions that Trump took (2/29).", "created_utc": 1584584245.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkw5zi1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fknh9x", "parent_id": "t1_fkvdrv7", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9a", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkw5zi1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldpolitics/comments/fknh9x/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fkw5zi1/"}
