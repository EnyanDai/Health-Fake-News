That\u2019s the topic of this entire thread. \n\nThis is what Fake News keeps repeating without evidence. Can you provide it for them?\n\n>So when he says 5 to 0, he\u2019s still trying to say this is all no big deal. This isn\u2019t an address to the 5 families. It\u2019s a statement on a global pandemic.\n\nNo he cl;early meant they will get better. And trying to calm people down. Not a lie since that VAST majority of patients accoerding to Infectious Diseases of America  get better.\n\n>I feel like for every lie trump tells, or stupid thing he says, trump supporters either hang on to the fact that a single sentence was technically correct regardless or broader context, or claim that a specific sentence was taken out of context even if the single sentence in isolation was ridiculous to anyone with common sense. And which of the two they choose, is always the wrong way to look at things. You\u2019ve picked the former. Thoughts?\n\nYOu feel like that?\n\nI prove the opposite with evidence. There is nothing stupid about saying \"go to zero.\":  I know that the fake news can say anything like that criticism which is a bizarre criticism and the haters will just go along.\n\nCommon sense is obviously saying \"oh he meant get better. whats the big deal?\"\n\nCheck it out yourself. \n\n**total cases**\n\n**468,523**\n\n**Total Deaths**\n\n**21,192**\n\n**Total Recovered(GONE TO ZERO)**\n\n**113,780**\n\n[https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)", "created_utc": 1585186666.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flinyai", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fly2x9", "parent_id": "t1_fliai7d", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cr3o", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flinyai", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fly2x9/what_is_your_opinion_of_the_coronavirus_video/flinyai/"}
