I think leaving shutdowns and local responses to the states is preferable to the federal, and even then it\u2019s been too heavy handed. \n\nI think the quarantines should be more tailored and less general. For a governor Wolf, as an example, to shut down an entire state (PA) when the state has had 1 death and most rural counties haven\u2019t even had cases... the damage to the economy, the negative outcome and will be more wide spread and more impactful to people then the virus could ever hope to be. (All the while allowing flights to come in from Seattle to Philly and Pittsburgh, I might add.)\n\nI don\u2019t think the response has been commensurate to the crisis at all. We\u2019re compounding our problems, making huge, rippling, damaging and unprecedented steps based on new and incomplete info. \n\nSouth Korea and even Washington state, our own epicenter of the Chinese virus, are on the downward curve after a month and after much less damage to their economy.\n\nSo while I approve of Trump\u2019s handling overall, and think he saw farther ahead then most in preparing and responding (early travel bans and quarantine), I think the president\u2019s response has been a bit overboard, and too socialistic for my taste.", "created_utc": 1584771373.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl379ye", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fly2x9", "parent_id": "t1_fl36hkr", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cr3o", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fl379ye", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fly2x9/what_is_your_opinion_of_the_coronavirus_video/fl379ye/"}
