They are the optimist, as they are the person who is projecting their image of America ahead to work towards. That is a basic understanding that should be known to all. Obama didnt go and be vocal about how many civilians and children got killed in drone strikes leading up to certain points in his administration. It was his message that he pushed that the sad casualties will be worth it to the bigger cause. Not that each death didn't go unconsidered. Do you understand its relevancy to our discussion?\n\nTrump for the health of the nation needs to distinguish how there is a narrative that exists to maximize potential fear to court opinion to the side of that criticizing the administration. The left elite media ha e lost control of their narrative in the sense it has become a negative perception out of every action by the president. Do you not agree that exists? We don't exist in fairy land. We are in a modern instant information age that Obama didnt have to deal with nearly to this degree. Technology pervades our daily life more every single day. Do you get the importance of that?\n\nCan we move forward with this conversation, or is it important to make deeper conversations before moving ahead?", "created_utc": 1584498377.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fksu0xs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka5wb", "parent_id": "t1_fksrmo6", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fksu0xs", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka5wb/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fksu0xs/"}
