We were **wrong**. We are correcting to be better prepared. We are Americans. We will get through this just like we have before, time and time again.\" I would have been satisfied. All I've ever wanted him to do is drop the hyperbole, drop the persona, drop the \"best of the best\" and \"worst of the worst\" and act like a person. Not the cartoon mayor of NY elitism, just a person with humility and accountability.\n\nBut he couldn't even do that. We have video of him not taking it seriously. And even with that, he comes out,  and claims no responsibility for his administration's response. And stop being so fucking divisive, making everything about himself and his petty war with democrats or anyone who doesn't like him. In 2013 he tweeted \"Leadership: Whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.\" But the rules are always different for him. \n\nThe reality is the bar for his behavior is incredibly low for people who don't support him and he can't even clear that at a time when we need unity the most. I would have absolutely been satisfied but he can't dropped the snake oil salesman act for a second.", "created_utc": 1584629011.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkxiqba", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fkcwca", "parent_id": "t1_fkxacbn", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584629948.0, "name": "t1_fkxiqba", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fkcwca/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fkxiqba/"}
