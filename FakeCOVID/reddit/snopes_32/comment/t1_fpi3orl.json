That's a fact, but let's look at the quote. \n\n\"They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they\u2019ve been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning, they lost, it\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We\u2019re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\"\n\nHe described the virus, in a maliciously deceiving way, to me as not being serious. \"We\u2019re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that\" especially. That's malicious deception hands down, inargubaly. \n\nWhat's the definition of hoax? \"To comically or maliciously deceive\". \n\nSo he didn't call the virus a hoax technically. He just described the virus' effects using the exact definition of the word hoax! Way better? \n\nI get that maybe this isn't aimed totally at you, you seem mostly reasonable. I just wanted to point out why your argument is a little dishonest and that's why I wondered if this was a talking point.", "created_utc": 1588633040.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpi3orl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t1_fpi29ko", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpi3orl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fpi3orl/"}
