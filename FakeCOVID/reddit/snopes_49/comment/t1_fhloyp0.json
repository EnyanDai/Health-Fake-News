I actually love your lyrics / poetry and am aware a lot of truth is being spoken here.   Please keep up the spiritual work, brother\n\nBeing a music producer myself, I just wanted to constructively comment that you are over mastering and/or compressing.  This can happen easily with out of the box mastering plugins (ex: soundgoodizer or maximus in FL studio land).  I have the problem myself sometimes.  The best mixing and mastering takes time.  I can try to help more if you are seeking it.  If you are open to the idea I can even give a shot in one of your tracks if you send over the individual unmixed/mastered tracks, but again, that's completely all up to what you are comfortable with.\n\nAs for my stuff, perhaps you might like this one (it's a bit intense for most though)\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ignobalai/a-new-paradigm\n\n> This place we all live in,  \nIs filled to the brim with hate.  \nIt's a given the myths we readily permiss    \nInto this state and society  \nCreate a hellish gate albeit silently  \nWildly worship without sufficient sobriety  \nThinking their sinning is done righteously.  \nWhich is why I spit my lines so stridently  \nDefiantly, I ask you go against the crowd   \nShout out loud, FUCK those with clout  \nAnd those who claim they are the most devout.  \nCivilization is past those that are crowned.  \nThose who believe in salvation? That shit is un-profound  \nSo take a look at the well spun lies and,  \nSee nothing else keeps the world from organizing.  \nDeath is what we choose to write,  \nAnd if its out of sight its outta the mind.  \nWhich is why I chose to take the high road  \nMight travel alone but I'm not travelling blind  \nSeems the future remains so well disguised  \nI just know it's so damn ill designed.   \n\n(The rest of the lyrics are in the description)", "created_utc": 1581703040.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fhloyp0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_f3oida", "parent_id": "t1_fhl5si2", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1581703951.0, "name": "t1_fhloyp0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/f3oida/department_of_defense_confirms_coronavirus_is_a/fhloyp0/"}
