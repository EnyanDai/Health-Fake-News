That's not new. But, I'm responding to the digital manipulation post on First Draft, where basically one goes to write a news story. Also a great place to establish a global narrative.\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/Digital\\_Manipulation/comments/fhgt30/first\\_draft\\_launches\\_a\\_hub\\_of\\_information\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Digital_Manipulation/comments/fhgt30/first_draft_launches_a_hub_of_information_for/)\n\nGoing into the first draft site, and searching \"debunk\" comes up with a list of articles.\n\n[https://data.firstdraftnews.org/covid19/search.php?query=debunk](https://data.firstdraftnews.org/covid19/search.php?query=debunk)\n\nWhat i find interesting is the Dean Koontz theory of the Wuhan virus, supposedly \"debunked\" on there. [https://www.newschecker.in/article/news-detail/275\\_15106377](https://www.newschecker.in/article/news-detail/275_15106377)\n\nBut then later in the article, it states that the original russian city the virus was named after, Gorki, was changed to \"wuhan\" after the cold war. Not recently, but a while ago, as far back as 1989.\n\nSo who changed it to \"wuhan\" back in 1989? That's what I want to know. You didn't debunk the Dean Koontz theory newschecker, you just frickin proved it.\n\nOr you proved that someone read the book, and thought it would be a fun game to implement.\n\nAgain, I still don't know whether i necessarily believe that it was \"predicted.\" I think that its all just a game. Just like the simpsons \"predictions\" and such.\n\nEither way though, i'm off to buy out all of Walmart's toilet plungers.", "stickied": false}
