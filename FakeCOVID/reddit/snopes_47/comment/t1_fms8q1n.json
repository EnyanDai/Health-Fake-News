We know HIV, influenza, Ebola and several lesser known viruses all use furin to enter human cells, it's somewhat of a weak point we have and a new spike protein in coronaviruses capable of using this gateway could create a new way more infectious SARS-like virus.\n\nIn the Wuhan lab they wanted to study if this was possible so they recombined the receptor binding domain of Pangolin-CoV (90% similar) with a close ancestor of Bat-CoV-RaTG13 (96.2% similar), and created SARS-CoV-2 which was indeed way more infectious than their previous experiments, so infectious that it was able to leak the lab maybe through living on surfaces or something like that; or researchers being contaminated with the mice that they infected for the experiments.\n\nHere's their previous work in this area published in Nature,\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985)\n\nHere's a paper on COVID-19 talking about furin, ancestors and recombination,\n\n [https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(20)30360-2.pdf](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(20)30360-2.pdf)", "created_utc": 1586349807.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fms8q1n", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwqxiu", "parent_id": "t1_fmqt8pb", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fms8q1n", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fwqxiu/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fms8q1n/"}
