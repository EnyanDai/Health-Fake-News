They already had 2 coronavirus outbreaks under the same conditions, yet your suspicion for the third one goes towards lab experiments. Hmmm... it's not about sources, it's about filtering noise through logic. And let's turn the lab logic upside down. Wouldn't it be best to build a lab near the place where the virus can be found? Should they just build it far away just for lack of suspicion's sake? There have been a number of people (even here, on reddit) explaining that a manmade virus has some artefacts in their genome and it would be obvious during analysis. No such reports from serious scientists studying the virus have cone forward. This is what i would consider convincing. But at this moment, i only see speculation based on the proximity of the lab and security breaches there. But considering there were 2 previous outbreaks in the past, occam's razor still leans towards natural causes.", "created_utc": 1582008097.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fhzqx7q", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_f5m6b1", "parent_id": "t1_fhznuj4", "score": -3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fhzqx7q", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/f5m6b1/it_might_be_the_daily_mail_but_the_story_covers/fhzqx7q/"}
