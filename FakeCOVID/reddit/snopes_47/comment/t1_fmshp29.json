Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone.   \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis.\n\nSo we already know they've been experimenting with chimeric viruses in that lab and that's their current active research area, they have published papers in nature intentionally combining coronavirus and SARS receptor in a lab. How likely is it that they continued that research by intentionally combining coronavirus and HIV in a lab? \n\nAlso that early talk about HIV turned out to be partially wrong, \n\n [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033698/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033698/) \n\nFirst they thought HIV was the only virus that shared the same insertion region, but later they found that there's also three different bat coronaviruses that share the same insertion proteins, one of them RaTG13 is a 96.2% match for SARS-CoV-2 and experimenting with this virus would be way more in line with the labs previous research. Now the question is just whether this leaked the lab or happened completely by chance in nature.", "created_utc": 1586355685.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmshp29", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwqxiu", "parent_id": "t1_fmsecrr", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmshp29", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fwqxiu/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmshp29/"}
