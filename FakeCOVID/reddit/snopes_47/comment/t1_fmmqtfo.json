Typical old lady moderate democrat. Made over 100k a year, didn\u2019t want her taxes raised yet considered herself a real democrat. Didn\u2019t give a shit about poor people or homeless people, it\u2019s their fault for being poor or homeless, it\u2019s so easy to get a job, they\u2019re lazy etc. but called herself a Democrat. She once told a white coworker with a black child that the child\u2019s \u201cblack sounding name\u201d would hinder her work prospects when she was older. Completely the type to vote for Biden because he\u2019s not trump and think that just having a Democrat in office, even if they\u2019re really a republican, is enough. She had zero critical thinking skills and just bought whatever the mainstream news told her with no questions and would repeat it word for word. Anything that deviated from that at all was a \u201ccrazy conspiracy theory\u201d. To me, she was just as stupid as the trump culture which believes everything their fix news informs them.", "created_utc": 1586210315.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmmqtfo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvypds", "parent_id": "t1_fmlr4js", "score": -5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmmqtfo", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fvypds/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmmqtfo/"}
