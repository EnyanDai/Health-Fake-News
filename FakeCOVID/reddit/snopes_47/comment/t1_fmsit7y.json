That came a century ago. What about black plague before it in the 1300s?\n\nYou're complicating an event that keeps occuring naturally every decade or so, and every few decades to centuries it blows up worldwide. Could it be from the lab? Yeah. Market? Yeah.\n\nThe least I'll say is you're violating Occam's Razor. And I'll also add that spinning this narrative GIVES YOU NOTHING ACTIONABLE to fight the virus. Maybe it gives you more fingers to point at China, but what for? So you feel better? Knock yourself out, I'm out of this. As I said, I'm not into conspiracy theory debates.\n\n>Now the question is just whether this leaked the lab or happened completely by chance in nature.\n\nKeep asking yourself this question. To me, both the labs need to be secured, or shut down, and the wet markets should be shut down.\n\nSee? You don't need all answers in order to do the right thing. \"It's from a lab or from a wet market\" is sufficient information to act. And we need to act, not train our mouth and finger muscles with empty chat all day.", "created_utc": 1586356319.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmsit7y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwqxiu", "parent_id": "t1_fmshp29", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmsit7y", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fwqxiu/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmsit7y/"}
