Coronaviruses are single-stranded and it would be way more unlikely.\n\nLook at this paper, discussing recombination\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108124/pdf/ciaa219.pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108124/pdf/ciaa219.pdf)\n\nKnowing if SARS-CoV-2 have some type of new mechanism that makes recombination more likely would be incredibly important to know. If we can determine that its origin was indeed from a natural recombination, then we know it's capable of it.\n\nThe implications of this would be, as the paper explains,\n\n>This report provides the first evidence for genetic recombination\u2014a new way of evolution besides mutation in 2019-nCoV. The existing of genetic recombination has the following implications: two different 2019-nCoV strains should have coinfected the same cell; a 2019-nCoV strain might acquire new traits like virulence and drug susceptibility directly from other strains; the adaptability of 2019-nCoV to human immune system might be significantly strengthened through genetic recombination; the accuracy of diagnosis based on serologic and molecular biology assays might be compromised; and the transmission tracking based on phylogenetics tree could be misleading since the topology of mutation route is a network rather than a tree\n\nRight now many countries entire strategies are based on \"herd immunity\", if we know the virus has in the past undergone radical recombinations then that would be a useless strategy since the virus will be very adaptable to the human immune system. We may need to change course and try to prevent the spread at all cost until a vaccine is developed.\n\nIf however the original recombination was done artificially in a lab and we find that the virus is only capable to very minor recombinations, it wouldn't really be a big deal for our strategy and plan.\n\nAnd of course, if we continue this research and find more evidence for big recombination events between the different strains of the virus then we can drop the lab theory.", "created_utc": 1586358693.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmsn6wa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwqxiu", "parent_id": "t1_fmsit7y", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmsn6wa", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fwqxiu/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmsn6wa/"}
