Two weeks later larger numbers of cases appeared that had a connection to the market, but fully 30% still did not. Indication is therefore that the virus came into the market through human-human transmission before it went out, rather than appearing via animal-human transmission inside the market.\n\nA quickly and mysteriously withdrawn preprint by Botao Xiao et. al. in February pointed out that bats were collected and surgery performed on them at the Wuhan CDC, 280m from the market, making inappropriately disposed of tissue a potential source of pathogens.\n\nIn this context worth noting that in mid-February China decided to tighten rules on the disposal of lab materials. Also that it has been reported that a Chinese scientist, Li Ning, was sentenced in January for \"selling experimental animals to local markets\".\n\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\n\nhttps://img-prod.tgcom24.mediaset.it/images/2020/02/16/114720192-5eb8307f-017c-4075-a697-348628da0204.pdf\n\nhttp://www.ecns.cn/m/news/sci-tech/2020-02-17/detail-ifztrmvi9821649.shtml\n\nhttps://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-03-05/us-chinese-distrust-inviting-dangerous-coronavirus-conspiracy", "created_utc": 1586265298.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmop1kx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwjkxb", "parent_id": "t3_fwjkxb", "score": 40, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmop1kx", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/fwjkxb/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmop1kx/"}
