The natural route has hit a dead-end and the genetic evidence is getting hard to explain as something that could occur naturally, it being made in a lab in a way similar to their previous research,\n\n [https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985) \n\nIs starting to make a lot more sense. However if you think this just happened in a lab holding cell, that makes no sense, there's close contact between sick animals and humans all over the world, there's 7 billion people, why would that happen in a lab rather than in just another wet market where we know they occasionally sell illegal wild animals?", "created_utc": 1586352976.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmsd8z9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwqxiu", "parent_id": "t1_fmsag1e", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmsd8z9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fwqxiu/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmsd8z9/"}
