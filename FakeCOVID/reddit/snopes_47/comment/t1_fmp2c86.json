This is probably coincidence but I\u2019ll link it\n\nhttps://streamable.com/3zao55", "created_utc": 1586273084.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmp2c86", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwjkxb", "parent_id": "t1_fmp1bfv", "score": 32, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586273403.0, "name": "t1_fmp2c86", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/fwjkxb/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmp2c86/"}
