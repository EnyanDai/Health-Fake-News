China has been lying about their numbers since day 0. I remember people saying the crematories were burning 24/7 in Wuhan. Then people saying there's no way it's that bad...2 months later and Lombardy was basically in the same situation. China got fucked here. \n\nWe're only hearing about the first world countries because everyone didn't expect top of the line health care systems to collapse. Sad but true, no one cares about India, Iran, most African countries etc. To many people assume they are just poor countries that are too far gone to even be cared about. Corona is a sure thing in those places.\n\n China is trying to be like those places so they can fly under the radar until they come up with a \"vaccine\" to cure all their people. Then the CCP will use it as propaganda. \"Look! Western countries don't care about you! They exiled you and turned their backs to you. Who nursed you back to health? Xi! Hong Kongwished for this virus! Hong Kong bad!\"\n\nTl:dr: Don't believe China and numbers. They got destroyed but want to create their own picture. They will blame their deaths on western culture to keep CCP in power.", "created_utc": 1586335654.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmru8jx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwqxiu", "parent_id": "t3_fwqxiu", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmru8jx", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fwqxiu/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmru8jx/"}
