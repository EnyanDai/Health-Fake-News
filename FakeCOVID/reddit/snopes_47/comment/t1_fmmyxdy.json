My research started with a tweet by Richard Ebright (a world renowned biologist/biosafety expert) referencing article 1. Here's my trail of research so far-\n\nArticle 1. Published 2 days ago. Evidence suggests highly that SARS-CoV-2 spread to humans through an intermediary animal. the most likely intermediary animal is either ferrets or tree shrews (no longer pangolins.)\n\n[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.025080v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.025080v1)\n\nThen, digging back I discovered Chinese labs have been using Tree Shrews for testing the transmission of many viruses. this is because tree shrews are small, plentiful, and are suitable candidates for human pathogen testing.\n\nArticle 2 (Conducted at Wuhan Institute of Virology)\n\n[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12250-019-00106-3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12250-019-00106-3)\n\nArticle 3. (not conducted at WIV, but conducted in China.)\n\n[https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-017-0859-5](https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-017-0859-5)\n\nNext, Richard Ebright at the same time a tweeting about Article 1 tweeted about Article 4 below. Article 4. notes very importantly that they discovered SARS-CoV-2 is capable of airborne transmission in ferrets. It is a known fact that novel coronaviruses are being studied all over the world in BSL-2 labs (not just WIV).\n\nArticle 4.\n\n [https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/cell-host-microbe/PDFs/chom\\_2285\\_preproof.pdf](https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/cell-host-microbe/PDFs/chom_2285_preproof.pdf) \n\nHere's the big deal, if you are not aware BSL-2 assumes the pathogens being studied are not capable of airborne transmission. Airborne diseases are classified under BSL-3 standards. Labs all over the world (WIV) have been studying novel coronaviruses in intermediary animals capable of airborne transmission without respirators! Its only been a matter of time until something like this leaked!\n\n[https://consteril.com/biosafety-levels-difference/](https://consteril.com/biosafety-levels-difference/)\n\nIts strange that Ebright posted these 2 articles side by side, after weeks before suggesting a possibility it was a lab leak and stating that WIV had been studying novel coronaviruses with BSL-2 standards...could he be trying to coyly tell us something?\n\nI'm a complete novice but I'm starting to wonder if a natural event is really the most parsimonious option at this point as opposed to accidental lab leak of a naturally occurring virus.", "created_utc": 1586214747.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmmyxdy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvypds", "parent_id": "t1_fmlekdd", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586215997.0, "name": "t1_fmmyxdy", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fvypds/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmmyxdy/"}
