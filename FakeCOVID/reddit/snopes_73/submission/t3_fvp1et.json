They can catch it from humans (which is how they believe the tigers became sick), and spread it to each other (the study mentioned in the two articles about house cats was to test if they could spread it), but it's unknown if they can spread it back to people. It sounds like their symptoms are mild if they do get sick, and they do not get as sick as people do (so far they've only been shown to have dry coughs, and the Bronx zoo tigers are expected to fully recover). Dogs, pigs, and birds are believed to be safe.  \n\n\nBe careful letting your cat wander outside, and if you believe you could be sick isolate yourself from your cats.", "stickied": false}
