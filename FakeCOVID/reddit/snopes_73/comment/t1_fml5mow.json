All of us who work in this field do it BECAUSE we love animals. It is our goal to give them the absolute best possible life that we can. Besides that, my job doesn\u2019t entail any of the actual research; I just provide care.\n\nThe animals I care for are used in research on several types of cancer, diabetes, covid-19, nausea and balance in zero-gravity (this lab collaborates with NASA), organ transplants, and the development of a device to help physically disabled or paralyzed people regain control of their bladder. Research animals also must be used for veterinary medicine. I agree that using animals for medical research is not ideal, but it\u2019s the best thing we currently have for many procedures/diseases. I encourage you to look up the very in-depth laws that animal researchers have to follow. Our animals - from the primates down to mice and zebrafish - are loved, and are treated better than many people treat their pets.", "created_utc": 1586179201.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fml5mow", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "parent_id": "t1_fml1rwh", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586180498.0, "name": "t1_fml5mow", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvkx7k/bronx_zoo_says_one_of_its_tigers_has_tested/fml5mow/"}
