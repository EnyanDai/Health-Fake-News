You also have different treatments and procedures for COV-ID than you do for other sicknesses. \n\n> We need to be figuring out who is asymptomatic.\n\nEventually, not right now. Everyone should assume they are and stay home. That's the whole point of the lock downs. They can't test everyone and it's not worth trying. Lock downs and self quarantining needs to happen first.\n\n>  Understanding of infection of tigers - who very few people have interactions with, maybe 1-2 people at the zoo - is something that can happen when we aren't literally in the midst of a quarantine.\n\nIt's not just Tigers.
