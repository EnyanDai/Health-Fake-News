So do other animals.\n\n\n>Other scientists say the findings are interesting, but cat owners should not be alarmed just yet. The results are based on lab experiments in which a small number of animals were deliberately given high doses of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, and do not represent real-life interactions between people and their pets, says virologist Linda Saif at the Ohio State University in Wooster. There is no direct evidence that the infected cats secreted enough coronavirus to pass it on to people, she says. \n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00984-8\n\n\n>The team, led by virologist Bu Zhigao, introduced samples of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the noses of five domestic cats. When two of the animals were euthanized six days later, the researchers found viral RNA, as well as infectious virus particles, in their upper respiratory tracts.    \n\n>The other three infected cats were put in cages next to uninfected felines. The team later detected viral RNA in one of these exposed cats, which suggests that it contracted the virus from droplets breathed out by the infected cats. All four of the infected cats also produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. \n\n\n\n>Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in cats should be considered as part of efforts to eliminate COVID-19 in humans, the authors note in the preprint\n\n\n___\n\n>Previous studies of SARS-CoV, the related coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), showed2 that cats can be infected and pass it on to other cats. But \u201cthere was no indication during the SARS pandemic that SARS-CoV became widespread in house cats or was transmitted from cats to humans\u201d, says Saif.", "created_utc": 1586181132.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fml8h4o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "parent_id": "t1_fmj5gh0", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fml8h4o", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvkx7k/bronx_zoo_says_one_of_its_tigers_has_tested/fml8h4o/"}
