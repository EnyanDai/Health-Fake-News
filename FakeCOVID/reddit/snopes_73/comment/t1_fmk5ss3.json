I suggest taking your shoes off near your front door and spraying them down with alcohol. Deal with packing materials as quickly as possible and remember that your cat or dog could rub his nose on a contaminated surface out of curiosity.\n\nI've started using cheap plastic bags as a surface to open boxes on and then throw those bags out. It's a lot of plastic and a bit of an exhausting pain, but I hear sirens outside my window several times a day now. And my city, NYC, is set to run out of ventilators this coming week. \n\nSo Andromeda Strain it is from now on.", "created_utc": 1586145275.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmk5ss3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "parent_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmk5ss3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvkx7k/bronx_zoo_says_one_of_its_tigers_has_tested/fmk5ss3/"}
