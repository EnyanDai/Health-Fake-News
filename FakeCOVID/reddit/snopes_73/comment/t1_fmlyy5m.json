Then we remove the trash bag from the bin and deposit it in to a larger trash bin, or a dumpster if you live in apartment, outside of our homes. Then the government sends some men in a big truck to take the trash away... :|\n\nThe rats and squirrels, or whatever small rodents you guys have in your country, mess with the trash cans that are left outside, the one you have to take your trash bags to...\n\nAnd just because you don't have pests in your home doesn't mean no one does. You've never heard of an exterminator? There's and entire profession dedicated to removing pests from people's homes.\n\nYes, hygiene has mitigated the spread of disease tremendously...but there is still disease and it still spreads the same way.
