Please link some info about that if you have it. Per the CDC, they have not posted any evidence of pets contracting covid (despite reports of such outside of the US). They specifically state further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals are affected by covid. \n\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html\n\n\nAs for questioning the 6-ft distancing and washing hands, that is basic medical practice for infectious disease control. The single best thing you can do to protect yourself from pathogens is to wash your hands. I'm willing to bet you don't have any medical training or stem-related background if you think that's a lie told to us by our own government. If you don't have the background for such a subject, you should not be questioning hundreds of years of research and the countless lives lost dedicated to improving healthcare.\n\n\nDo your research. Use reliable sources. We can reduce the severity of this pandemic by using resources given to us by the CDC.", "created_utc": 1586145326.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmk5var", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvo4z8", "parent_id": "t1_fmk08aw", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn7", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586145678.0, "name": "t1_fmk5var", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/biology/comments/fvo4z8/a_tiger_at_the_bronx_zoo_tests_positive_for/fmk5var/"}
