If anything, a human understands hygeine measures that a cat does not. We otherwise have almost identical respiratory systems, and cats are more than capable of sneezing and coughing all over the place.\n\nBecause this is a potentially serious health matter, the precautionary principle applies. A lack of evidence against transmission between cats and humans requires us to assume it may occur.\n\nI am unsure if that is the reason behind the guidelines I recent read, issued by my country (Canada), but people are now encouraged to distance themselves from domestic animals as well as people if they are experiencing symptoms. No doubt, part of the concern is that virus can attach itself to fur and be spread through contact. But actual zoonotic infection seems plausible at this point.", "created_utc": 1586266182.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmoqdch", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvo4z8", "parent_id": "t1_fmjvoeh", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn7", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmoqdch", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/biology/comments/fvo4z8/a_tiger_at_the_bronx_zoo_tests_positive_for/fmoqdch/"}
