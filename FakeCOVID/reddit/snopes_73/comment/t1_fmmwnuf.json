IIRC, the common cold is also caused by a corona virus.  \n\nFrom:  [https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/alerts/Pages/coronavirus-faqs.aspx#1-1](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/alerts/Pages/coronavirus-faqs.aspx#1-1)\n\n## About COVID-19\n\n### What are coronaviruses?\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses cause  illness in humans and others cause illness in animals, such as bats,  camels, and civets. Human coronaviruses generally cause mild illness,  such as the common cold.\n\nRarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve to infect and spread among humans, causing severe diseases such as [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/SARS.aspx) which emerged in 2002, and [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/MERS-coronavirus.aspx) which emerged in 2012.\n\n### What is the COVID-19 virus?\n\nCOVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously  identified in humans. It was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province,  China, where it has caused a large and ongoing outbreak. It has since  spread more widely in China. Cases have since been identified in several  other countries. The COVID-19 virus is closely related to a bat  coronavirus.\n\nThere is much more to learn about how COVID-19 is spread, its  severity, and other features associated with the virus; epidemiological  and clinical investigations are ongoing. \n\nOutbreaks of new coronavirus infections among people are always a public health concern. The situation is evolving rapidly.", "created_utc": 1586213508.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmmwnuf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fw0weu", "parent_id": "t1_fmmuaq9", "score": 18, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_qez38", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmmwnuf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TruckerCats/comments/fw0weu/goose_and_maverick_are_still_home_in_quarantine/fmmwnuf/"}
