But on house cats it seems it was more innocuous than it was on this tiger, surprisingly. They didn't develop symptoms.\n\nAnd it required an inordinate amount of virus to infect them. They don't seem to transmit the virus to one another very easily, but it does happen. Scientists say they probably wouldn't ordinarily infect people, but that kind of weirdly too affectionate person-on-cat action/kissing is not advised. Regardless of this virus specifically, just in general.\n\nIf I recall, ferrets seem to be infected more easily, and scientists may plan to have them as \"guinea pigs\" on research.\n\nDogs seem to not get infected, even though there was an instance of a Chinese dog that was infected, very early on. So, while not altogether impossible, it should be much rarer than it's with cats. Which is probably already rare enough that they won't become urban virus reservoirs or something.\n\nBut maybe one should also think of vaccines for cats, just in case.", "created_utc": 1586211101.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmms9v8", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_fw7819", "parent_id": "t1_fmmpku2", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_30b6q", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmms9v8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/fw7819/a_tiger_at_the_bronx_zoo_tests_positive_for/fmms9v8/"}
