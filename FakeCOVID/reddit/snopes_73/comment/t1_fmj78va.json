Zoos are already short staffed as it is with the outbreak...this is going to make everything so much harder. With PPE already in short supply or impossible to find, how are we supposed to protect these animals?\n\nPeople joke about tigers being more valuable than humans and I get it, it's shitty. But these animals are precious to our ecosystem and some of them--like Amur leopards--are critically endangered. There are less than 200 left in captivity and the wild combined. If the captive population were devastated by this virus, that would be a horrific blow to conservation efforts.\n\n*EDIT*: I'm gonna use the popularity of this comment to link to two things: \n\n1) a [press release](https://vetmed.illinois.edu/illinois-experts-id-coronavirus-in-tiger/?fbclid=IwAR0tfrkIMUgetKBH75hmqY5q518enYmPqfUA0FmvmaW5cvPRusLdNkkZDok) from the veterinary scientists who tested this tiger explaining their reasoning and \n\n2) a video a keeper friend of mine made [in response to Tiger King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2IeAWUIaiU). \n\nLots of misinformation and fear-mongering going on in these comments...lots of valuable questions being asked, too.", "created_utc": 1586124451.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj78va", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "parent_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "score": 330, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586133665.0, "name": "t1_fmj78va", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvkx7k/bronx_zoo_says_one_of_its_tigers_has_tested/fmj78va/"}
