Plus it's one of those things I'll constantly wonder about too. Definitely glad I found someone better too. Old vet never even sent a sorry for your loss card or anything. Just paid my bill and nothing. \n\nThankfully I'm getting paid to stay home right now and outside of going to the store haven't really been out. Try to only go once a week since right now trying to get dog food as my little guy as an allergy to something which makes his butt explode and not about to switch his food up to roll the dice on that unless I absolutely have to. He's still got plenty to last the next few weeks but would feel a lot better if I had another bag ready to go like I usually do. \n\nBeen doing take-out now and then myself since there aren't many cases here but once that number starts going up I'm cutting that out. Already a bit of a germaphobe too thanks to work so I'm already pretty good about not touching my face, washing my hands, and keeping areas clean but now I'm even more on top of it than before. Minimize what I touch when I'm out like won't even take my phone out and debit card, wallets, keys, all that get disinfected when I get home.\n\nFunny how my co-workers regularly get sick this time of year but I don't cause I'm always so on top of things.", "created_utc": 1586156223.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkimcz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "parent_id": "t1_fmki4ln", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkimcz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvkx7k/bronx_zoo_says_one_of_its_tigers_has_tested/fmkimcz/"}
