That's an estimate. It's also [true](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27191967/?from_term=asymptomatic+influenza&from_pos=3) that a sizable [portion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5967351/) of those infected with the flu are  [asymptomatic](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/66/10/1511/4682599), which results in underreporting. \n\nAdditionally, given that it's a new virus unlike the flu, nearly everyone has the potential to be infected. Worst-case models show that without dramatic measures being taken (you know, like enforcing social distancing), up to [81% of the US population](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) may become infected. Under such a situation, even if the mortality rate were as low as 0.5%, that would still result in 1-2 million deaths.\n\nYou have demonstrated throughout this thread that you are hilariously misinformed. I'm not even going to touch upon your....rodent infestation hypothesis as a mode of COVID-19 transmission because seriously, what the fuck? This might be the *dumbest* thing you've said, and that's genuinely impressive. However, most importantly, you also said \n\n>The virus is here. Hiding inside isn't going to stop that. Now we could deal with this like rational adults or we could freak out and enact futile and detrimental measure to drag out the process.\n\nYou fundamentally do not understand why the measures being used are taking place. The whole point of shutting everything down and social isolation is to \"drag out the process.\" That is *literally* what experts mean by \"flattening the curve.\" We're trying to not overload the healthcare system. Even if not \"EVERYONE\" adheres to it, which you keep parroting, it will still dramatically reduce the peak of the infection. That mortality rate is not static - it is strongly dependent on the availability of hospital beds, drugs, ventilators, etc. \"Dragging this out\" could result in the same overall number of people getting infected, but with dramatically lower mortality rates because of healthcare availability.  For example, a recently updated [model](https://www-wmcactionnews5-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.wmcactionnews5.com/2020/04/06/covid-model-projects-fewer-deaths-hospital-stays-officials-urge-caution/?outputType=amp&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D&amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=15862339880568&amp_ct=1586234059225&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wmcactionnews5.com%2F2020%2F04%2F06%2Fcovid-model-projects-fewer-deaths-hospital-stays-officials-urge-caution%2F) now projects dramatically fewer deaths from COVID-19 due to higher estimates hospital beds for those who need them. However, this model assumes that social distancing measures will stay in place.\n\nI honestly don't know at this point if you just have a compulsive need to be a contrarian or if you are genuinely this stupid. Have you even bothered to pay attention to what's happening or has happened in places like NY, NJ or Italy? Or are you just too egocentric? We have seen and are seeing the devastation that's occurring even *with* social distancing and isolation. And now there's some early evidence to show that the curve is starting to flatten in places like NYC and NJ, largely due to the efforts social distancing measures that have been enacted. Maybe you should give Gov. Cuomo a call and tell him that he's overreacting the thousands of people dying in NY's hospitals now. I'll even make it easy for you and give you his number: (518) 474-8390\n\nbut lol fuck old people, amirite?", "created_utc": 1586274595.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmp53i2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvm7lv", "parent_id": "t1_fmnmu64", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3ixag", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586282732.0, "name": "t1_fmp53i2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/imdbvg/comments/fvm7lv/tiger_at_new_yorks_bronx_zoo_tests_positive_for/fmp53i2/"}
