What part of that leads to the US not being a financial superpower as a result of this? Is the rest of the world unaffected by coronavirus? \"Superpower\" status is relative to other world powers.\n\n\nMost other \"First World\" countries are handling COVID-19 better than us, I suspect. China is shipping goods to other coutnries again, and it was already the top contender to be the next Big Kid on the Block.\n\n>>You'd expect national debt to go up in a crisis like that. You'd expect governments all over the world to carry a lot more debt as a result of this. Do you think other countries aren't having massive unemployment right now as well?\n\nWe already boosted the debt with a tax break that wasn't going to be paid for and now have at least 2 (maybe three) new stimulus packages already sent or in the pipeline.\n\n>>Did I mention who is in charge in the White House currently?\n\n> 4 years of a complete blithering idiot in charge isn't actually enough to change the country that much.\n\nExcept when he's in charge during a global crisis and plans his policy around photo-ops for re-election rather than actually handling the crisis.\n\n.\n\nAnd Trump isn't a blithering idiot when it comes to public relations. His numbers with his base are at an all time high, I think. Look at the number of death threats Fauci has gotten for the most mildly worded rebukes of Trump imaginable.\n\nTrump has a *worship* base, not a fan-base.\n\nThey'd literally die for him. I expect a landslide re-election and him working to establish a non-democratic dynasty over the next four years.", "created_utc": 1586144755.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmk52vo", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_fvm3sv", "parent_id": "t1_fmk45li", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8f", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmk52vo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/skeptic/comments/fvm3sv/this_is_very_scary_tiger_at_nycs_bronx_zoo_tests/fmk52vo/"}
