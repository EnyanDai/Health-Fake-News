It got no attention though and I didn\u2019t hear about it until I read another person who commented it.\n\n\u201cVirus isolation was performed on previous samples taken from the Pomeranian with a negative result, indicating that no live virus was retrieved. This is in line with the amount of virus genetic material in the samples. Further serological testing has been conducted at the World Health Organization reference laboratory at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on the blood sample taken on March 3 and the final test result is positive. This indicates that the Pomeranian had developed an immune response to the viral infection with antibodies found in the blood. Veterinary experts and scientists from the Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences of City University of Hong Kong, as well as the School of Public Health of the HKU, have concluded that the result further supported that the Pomeranian has been infected with the COVID-19 virus.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202003/26/P2020032600756.htm?fontSize=1", "created_utc": 1586188066.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmlk9lf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "parent_id": "t1_fmjj4iv", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmlk9lf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvkx7k/bronx_zoo_says_one_of_its_tigers_has_tested/fmlk9lf/"}
