Gave her the first dose of antibiotics with ease and the day after she fought extremely fiercely to not take them(she let's me do anything to her normally).\n\n I figured something was up and having cases of corona in the neighborhood I figured it might actually be the virus. We decided to see if she would worsen without the antibiotics as she was not a fan even though they're candy to them. The 2 kittens had very mild caughs for about 2 days and the older one got better after a week orso(with only the 1 dose). This was around 4 weeks ago and I've not left the house until yesterday. \n\nI still think it was just the cat cold(flu?or whatever it's called) , but the way it occurred so abruptly and the kittens having the protective shots for it still doesn't sit well with me.", "created_utc": 1586155829.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmki89b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "parent_id": "t1_fmjegf8", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmki89b", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvkx7k/bronx_zoo_says_one_of_its_tigers_has_tested/fmki89b/"}
