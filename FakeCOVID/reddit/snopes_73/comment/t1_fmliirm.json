A large zoo would likely either have the equipment themselves for research/diagnostic purposes, or have research collaborators with access to the equipment. \n\nThe reagents that make the test specific to SARS-CoV-2 can be acquired for $20-30, and are not in shortage. The rest of the test can be done with whatever methods and reagents labs already have to isolate RNA, make cDNA, and run qPCR, each of which have many options available, and only specific types favored by hospitals (certain extraction kits that omit some of the more dangerous reagents from the more traditional method and simplify the process) are in short supply.\n\nRealistically, the only barrier to basic research labs testing people is sample acquisition, as it must be performed safely and the appropriate swabs are in very short supply.
