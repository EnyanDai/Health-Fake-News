However, I would be weary of these articles because the \u201csuper fast\u201d \u201ctest\u201d that the news has been talking about for a few weeks now only tests antibodies. The problem is that if you\u2019ve have had A corona virus (there are thousands of each category of virus for each animal in the world) sometime in the past, you\u2019d test positive lol. \n\nYou survived SARS? .... you\u2019d test positive for \u201ccorona\u201d. It\u2019s a BS test that people have been using to test already dead people to see if they had corona and then inflate the numbers. There was a guy in Houston (I think) who died of a heart attack and they tested for corona with the antibody test and he was \u201cpositive\u201d so they included this man with the death toll. \n\nBad science for news articles so that they can ask for more funding from the government, who doesn\u2019t have enough scientists to actually catch shady science. \n\nTHOUGH, this is not to say that the virus isn\u2019t extremely dangerous... it is. There\u2019s no question about it.
