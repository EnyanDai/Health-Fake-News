If covid-19 originally came from bats and was engineered or mutated to infect human cells, then how has it now infected a completely unrelated species? This seems highly suspect and implausible.\n\nIt seems you debunked your own points by saying this:\n\n>If the virus is on your pets fur and your pick it up on your hand and then contaminate food etc, then BAM it was just passed from the pet to the owner. Please do try to THINK before you type.\n\nYes, exactly, pets can have COVID-19 particles on them and test positive for COVID-19 without being infected or showing symptoms.  That is what I've been trying to explain this entire time.  Maybe you should be the one thinking before you type.\n\n>Wait a minute, is that like when the World Health Organization stated: **\"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China\"**\n\nThat is a prime example of science doing as science does, and correcting its self.  At the time there was in fact no evidence of human to human spread, but then more evidence was collected and conclusions had to be changed.", "created_utc": 1586167311.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmksuld", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvmd95", "parent_id": "t1_fmj9g3w", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmksuld", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fvmd95/tiger_at_nycs_bronx_zoo_tests_positive_for/fmksuld/"}
