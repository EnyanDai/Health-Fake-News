This was the result of deliberately high exposures rather than the level a cat might actually encounter in the real world, so the results of this experiment might not necessarily translate to the real world in terms of transmission.\n\nIf you have a pet cat it might be wise to keep them indoors and not have them lick your face, as the CDC currently suggests, until we have more complete information because as it stands there's a lot of unknowns, but human-to-human transmission definitely remains the most important thing rather than focusing on domestic animals as potential vectors, as even under high levels of covid-19 infection the transmission rate to non infected cats was low.", "created_utc": 1586171344.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkwj10", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvo4z8", "parent_id": "t1_fmk8p7k", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn7", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586172043.0, "name": "t1_fmkwj10", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/biology/comments/fvo4z8/a_tiger_at_the_bronx_zoo_tests_positive_for/fmkwj10/"}
