Nobody who has any idea how traveling to the moon works would suggest \"the slingshot effect\" has anything to do with it. It certainly does not. However, just because you have heard a bunch of totally wrong ideas about how a rocket gets to the moon does not mean it can't be done.\n\nEscape velocity is a very real thing, although \" where gravity doesn't matter if you are traveling fast enough \" is really misrepresenting what is going on. Since gravity decreases with the square of the distance, at any given distance, there is an initial velocity great enough such that the rocket will not fall back.\n\n\" can you build a pendulum that can swing higher than its initial starting point? \"\n\nAny pendulum can swing higher than its initial starting point \\*if an initial acceleration is applied in the direction of the swing\\*. In other words, if I give the pendulum a push (a force providing an initial acceleration), the pendulum can easily swing higher than its starting point. Why? Because after the push, the pendulum has a non-zero initial velocity. Just like our rocket. The rocket initial burns fuel to create a force that gives an acceleration. When the rocket's burn stops, it is like the pendulum that has been pushed. It has a non-zero velocity at that point, so it can \"go higher than it started\". Whether or not the rocket can escape completely or not depends on the distance it has traveled (since gravity is weakening with the square of the distance), and the velocity it has achieved. These are totally calculable things based on the equations for motion.", "created_utc": 1583161912.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fj9xiih", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fawf9o", "parent_id": "t1_fj20cwc", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fj9xiih", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fawf9o/is_it_a_coincidence_that_every_election_year_has/fj9xiih/"}
