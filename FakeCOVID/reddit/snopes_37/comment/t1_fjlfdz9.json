Here are the facts:\n\nSARS:  Appeared in 2002 and ended in 2004!\n\nAVIAN  (H7N9) FLU -  first discovered in 1878. The most recent outbreak began in early 2013 and ended early 2017.\n\nSWINE (H1N1) Flu- 2009-2010. On March 18, 2009, CDC reported that the swine flu reached the United States. \n\nMERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) -  2012 2014- while it was first reported in Suadi Arabia in 2012, \nIt was not until May 2014 that the CDC announced the first US cases of MERS - two patients, one in Indiana and another in Florida, and both health care workers who live in Saudi Arabia and have traveled to the US.\n\nEBOLA virus- 1976-2016 -  the virus has been around since at least 1976 (Source: CDC), but the latest deadly outbreaks were during: Jun\u2013Aug 2012 (Uganda); Jun\u2013Nov 2012 and Aug\u2013Nov 2014 (Congo), with the most deadliest occurring between Dec 2013\u2013Jan 2016 (multiple countries) and killing 28,616 people. \n\nZIKA virus - 1952 (first discovery in humans).
