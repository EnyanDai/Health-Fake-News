I'd paste that Carl Sagan quote about ignorance taking over, but we're almost there already. \n\nI have difficulty filtering out how much of these ridiculous conspiracies are genuine and how much of it is manufactured either directly or as secondary propaganda.\n\nUnfortunately the fact is that a lot of people are basically grown children. They lack critical thinking skills and lack fundamental scientific knowledge to build their understanding of the world on. They don't know what the electromagnetic spectrum is, they don't know the difference between a bacteria and a virus, they don't know the difference between an atom and a molecule.\n\nThese are neighbors, business owners, other seemingly sane people, but they have gigantic gaps in their worldview and they let a bunch of nonsense fill it in.
