Some people are just more passionate about the truth than others, even if it means they don't get to feel all warm and comfortable all the time. \n\nI'm really bad at watching long videos as well. I know I should watch them but they tend to stay queued up in background tabs while I do other things. It's a form of addiction the instant gratification thing, and I'm trying to quit because I'm wasting time and not learning anything properly. I've been following Sam Harris' meditation course recently and that's helping, not just because meditation is good for addiction and patience/concentration but because he also does long interviews with people and it's just an hour or more of audio only, so that's been a good antidote and detox. \n\nI liked that second video with Sam and the vicar type guy because they were both so reasonable and considerate in the way they went about discussing their differences. Although I like Hitchslaps as much as the next guy, there was something very rewarding about seeing how the same discussion can be had politely and constructively. Also, I came away feeling like I understood the religious perspective a lot better. Certainly I learnt more than watching my side winning in just another 'Sam Harris DESTROYS religious nutjob' type vid.", "created_utc": 1586807182.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnb0p01", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fn66rcx", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnb0p01", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fnb0p01/"}
