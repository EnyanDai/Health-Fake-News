When a 2020 truck runs into a 2020 car they will both be on 5g and insurance companies will be able to see which car practiced safer driving and is liable. It's also going to connect to all those Samsung smart fridges, so when you buy 3 cases of beer and 5 lbs of red meat each week your insurance company is gonna know and hike your rates. \n\nThis is the real fear of 5g. The idiots saying 5g causes coronavirus are just that, idiots, and they need to read a little bit up on what they're talking about.\n\nThe reason there is a push for 60ghz is because it allows for faster wireless transfers, but the higher the frequency the less distance you get. 60ghz 5g is only effective for 50m. This is not what is being installed on towers.
