One issue with this model (as I had read on the reviews) is that when it is runnning it can knock the WiFi out for a few seconds. \n\n\nI told my brother in law that I was pausing Netflix because he was about to use the microwave, because it would interfere. \n\nHe laughed his ass off like I was out of my mind, as if I had said that flushing the toilet affects my car\u2019s gas mileage. \n\nSo explained to him that WiFi uses microwaves, that\u2019s what the signal is based upon. \n\n\nSo now he is going around telling everyone that the microwaves in WiFi signals are slowly cooking us from the inside and he is 1000% sure that WiFi is the cause of all cancer and now he uses the oven to heat up his oatmeal.\n\n\nThe phenomena is almost as old as our species: people too dumb to understand science fear it, and are convinced it is the root of all evil.", "created_utc": 1586006348.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmek193", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuszca", "parent_id": "t3_fuszca", "score": 31, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586006544.0, "name": "t1_fmek193", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fuszca/uk_phone_masts_attacked_amid_5gcoronavirus/fmek193/"}
