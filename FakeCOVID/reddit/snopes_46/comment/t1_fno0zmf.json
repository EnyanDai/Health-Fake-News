The difference between the two is one is manmade EMF and the other is natural EMF. Manmade EMF is polarised in comparison to natural EMF which is unpolarised, from my studies my understanding is that mandmade EMF is polarised as it\u2019s needed to be directed and controlled (like electricity). There have been studies showing how polarised EMF can damage DNA and cause cancer due to it having a positive charge and therefor directing all positively charged ions out of a cell. A human cell needs balance, otherwise we have seen and studied how non balanced cells can be disruptive to the whole body and even cause cancer. The issue at hand is that 5g is a shorter wave length therefor more towers are needed in a shorter area in turn creating more polarised EMF. Start doing your own studies into why this is an issue not only for humans but especially wild life (bees etc).", "created_utc": 1587108151.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fno0zmf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2vsuj", "parent_id": "t3_g2vsuj", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3neie", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fno0zmf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracyundone/comments/g2vsuj/over_50_cell_towers_vandalized_in_uk_due_to_5g/fno0zmf/"}
