So, implicitly at least, he no longer needed it.\n\nThe thing about conspiracy theorists is they tend to believe indiscriminately, as he did. It's not a particular incident that they find particularly interesting, it's conspiracies in general. When it's to the point of being a way of thinking, I see it as more a way of seeing the conspiracist than the world. And of course it's not an unusual symptom of outright mental illness.\n\nIt's funny watching the X-Files back. When I was young of course Mulder was the hero, or course he was right, stupid Scully getting in the way of everything. But rewatching as an adult the guy is such an idiot, and nuts, wild accusations are always the first explanation out of his mouth based on nothing at all. Real-world Mulder would be a disaster.\n\nBut this of 5G thing, I don't know. I wonder if it's more a survivalist thing than a conspiracist thing.
