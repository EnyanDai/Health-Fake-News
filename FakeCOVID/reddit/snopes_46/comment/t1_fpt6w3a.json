I watched the Flat Earther documentary, and honestly I didn\u2019t see them as being idiots who believe an easily disproven ideology. I saw them as the people on the fringes of society where this group is their one shot at having friends. It was sad watching at times, because for some of them, that community is literally all they have. \n\nThere are some who actually believe it and mock people that don\u2019t share their beliefs, but the majority of them just seemed like people who were desperate for any kind of community. Fortunately, they have not turned violent as of yet. \n\nFrom there, I feel as though these people can be manipulated to perpetrate heinous acts such as the one mentioned in the article. They see that within their group, they are rewarded for taking action and being violent, and step up their attacks to move from verbal threats, to outright violence. It\u2019s a dangerous mob mentality when that group is literally all they have and are paranoid of any and all external sources of contradictory information because it threatens their community.", "created_utc": 1588885914.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpt6w3a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpsr74a", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpt6w3a", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpt6w3a/"}
