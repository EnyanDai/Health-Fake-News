It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if countries like China or Russia were behind these conspiracy theories and using them to sew doubt and chaos among the populace.\n\nMost people are sheeple and if you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll get caught up in all the sensationalism. It requires extreme skepticism, scrutiny, and non-emotional observation (with an open mind to reflect on one\u2019s biases) to fully analyze a situation and draw carefully considered conclusions.\n\nSomething most people forget is it is healthy and natural to see your opinions on a spectrum, ranging from not just a binary \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d, but including anything from \u201cmaybe\u201d to \u201cprobably true\u201d or \u201cprobably false\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cI lack enough data to make an informed decision\u201d are all acceptable and valid opinions to hold on an issue. The media loves to hype us into committing to a strong opinion, and this is a mistake, because once you do that you choose a side and your ego becomes involved. The ego then begins to try and tell you to stick to your decision, even against evidence to the contrary, because the ego doesn\u2019t like to get hurt.\n\nBasically, humanity would benefit from studying their ego, and propaganda, and how easy it is to get manipulated by misinformation, especially in the age of the internet.", "created_utc": 1587285763.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnva9dz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t3_g3mgns", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnva9dz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnva9dz/"}
