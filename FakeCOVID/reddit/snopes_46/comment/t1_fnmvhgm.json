Most of them started spewing nonsense 5 minutes into the ride. First we start with a lady shouting that no idea who created this virus, but that it was sure created in a lab. A guy with a very irritating voice starts to speak about how this was liberated to kill people, because \"we are too many people\" and they want to do population control. Another lady follows up, saying that his son-in-law sent her a WhatsApp chain 'proving' that a disease is launched every 100 years, the Spanish flu, Ebola, now this... (yes, Ebola outbreaks apparently happened 100 years ago I guess).\n\nThe whole bus became a competition for who could say the biggest bullshit about the virus.
