My husbands professor who\u2019s whole life is research on electrical pollution ( really interesting stuff - we already have lots of electrical pollution) ( electrical engineering) released a research paper on the possible affects of 5g. I\u2019m not saying it causes Coronovirus ( that\u2019s stupid) but the actual damage of 5g is yet to be proven safe.  \n\nThere are a lot of academics doing the research so don\u2019t just blindly think it\u2019s healthy, its still being studied. \n\nFor example : \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6765906/\n\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/we-have-no-reason-to-believe-5g-is-safe/\n\n\nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/646172/EPRS_BRI(2020)646172_EN.pdf\n\nFrom one of the journals: In addition, the appeal states that a large number of scientific publications illustrate EMF exposure effects such as an elevated risk of cancer, genetic damage, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, etc. The appeal points out not only harm to humans, but also to the environment.\nThe appeal recommends a moratorium on the deployment of 5G for telecommunications until potential hazards for human health and the environment have been fully investigated by scientists independent of industry. They urge the EU to follow Resolution 1815 of the Council\nof Europe, and demand that a new assessment is carried out by an independent task force.\nIn this regard, some scientists consider it necessary to establish new exposure limits that take account of the new characteristics of exposure. Such limits should be based on the biological effects of EMF radiation, rather than on the energy-based specific absorption rate.
