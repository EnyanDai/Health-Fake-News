Never Interfere With an Enemy While He\u2019s in the Process of Destroying Himself. \n\nI think people should not look at their offensive diplomatic approach as anything but a reflection of the dire strait that their domestic economy is. If you watch Chinese propaganda, which I do hope you all do if you can understand Chinese, is that they are starting to build a narrative of the \"Long March\" spirit. This could represent that China is preparing their citizens of the likelihood of the West isolating China economically. Therefore, we should see all these diplomatic moves simply as a warning sign that everyone who is in China, should immediately leave before it is deemed as too late. The regime is too irrational, given the current dire situation to act as a responsible power. China's economic downturn will only get worse, which in turn would only lead to more irrational and radical behaviors both internationally and domestically. \n\nIf there is a prime time to truly cut China off, it is now. The only consideration the West should consider on this matter is how to minimize the damage on it's own people and industries. Because if they don't decouple quickly, Western government will continue to treat China with the velvet gloves, instead of the fist that is necessary.", "created_utc": 1587606562.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo8yjbu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rxpp", "parent_id": "t3_g5rxpp", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo8yjbu", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China/comments/g5rxpp/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo8yjbu/"}
