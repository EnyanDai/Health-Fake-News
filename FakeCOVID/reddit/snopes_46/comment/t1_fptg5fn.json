I'm sure China could use \"stupidity\" as their excuse for torturing and keeping Uighur Muslims in \"labor camps\" right now, and if they did, what could anyone say to that? Nothing.\n\nIt's very difficult to \"solve\" our racial/generational/factual divides in these ways (\"punish the stupid ones\") without becoming brutal or totalitarian ourselves. That is the delicate dance.\n\nI feel we may have slightly differing views here, but I personally in a general sense don't believe in punishing our enemies because they're stupid or frustrate us (and I know you'll mention it's also that these people cause real true harm, and I get that and I understand), or the idea of revenge/retribution because it feels good. I think that takes us in the wrong direction as a society, and is a big factor to how humanity got here in the first place. I think it's important to fight off these primal sort of urges.\n\nI do realize these views are slightly more \"hippy\" in nature than the average but I do believe in them.", "created_utc": 1588890640.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptg5fn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptdm8p", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptg5fn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptg5fn/"}
