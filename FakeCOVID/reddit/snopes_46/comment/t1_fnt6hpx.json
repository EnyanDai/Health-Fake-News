It is a misunderstanding of how viruses and electromagnetism work. \n\nIt's not about \"misunderstanding\". They're deliberately looking for something to blame that isn't the Conservative party in America and the UK for the severity of the outbreak in their respective countries. You can sit down and explain virology and physics to these people until you're blue in the face, but they don't believe their dumbass conspiracy theories because of intellectual curiosity or a hunger for objective truth.\n\nAll Conservatives have brains that respond to fear, not empathy. They're scared about the situation, but they're equally scared that they'll be held responsible for electing the incompetent people that caused the situation to deteriorate much worse than it should have. Their fear and their egos drive them to deliberately \"misunderstand\", because acknowledging the facts of the situation means they were duped by corrupt, incompetent, evil \"politicians\" that used their own ideology against them and now their own gullibility has resulted in tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths. They can't take that, so they won't accept it and they'll just find imbecilic conspiracy theories to blame because they're all cowards.", "created_utc": 1587235547.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnt6hpx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnsnhdq", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnt6hpx", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnt6hpx/"}
