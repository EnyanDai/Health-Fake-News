It makes no sense.\n\nIs their really any mobile technology that is 100% secure? Where no data has a risk of being sent to private companies or governments?\n\nHuawei is the world's, by far, leader when ir comes to 5G. There is a significant risk that data from use of their equipment end up at Huawei. There is also a risk that data collected by Huawei end up in the hands of the Chinese government.\n\nLet's look at the alternatives, if we really can talk about alternatives. We all know that Nokia and Ericsson have a history of collecting data and this data has ended up with the NSA. So there is a significant risk that data will end with these companies and a significant risk that data will end up in the hands of the American government.\n\nAdd to that all the data used in apps. We all know how much data ends up at Google and Apple. The same us obviously the case for all the phone producers. The collect data and there is a significant risk that the data end up in the hands of government. \n\nSo really, nothing is safe. So it's not a question about security. France and Canada knows this as well as every single country in the world.\n\nSo if we cut the excuse, why does USA not want other countries to buy Huawei's products?", "created_utc": 1586592089.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn2k8q4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fmziphd", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn2k8q4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fn2k8q4/"}
