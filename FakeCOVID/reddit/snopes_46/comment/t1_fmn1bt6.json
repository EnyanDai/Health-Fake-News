Some of them even have a Dr. by their name, so they do actually have the knowledge to be able to dress up the theory with enough technical terms to make it sound legit. But once you actually research what they\u2019re saying, it becomes very clear that they\u2019re full of shit. This one guy claimed that 5G heated up oxygen molecules and breathing those molecules in is what causes health problems. Well, if an electromagnetic wave is heating up the particle that it comes into contact with, then it\u2019s transferring some amount of its energy to that molecule. That\u2019s why things heat up. It\u2019s a transfer of energy. If you\u2019re designing technology that transfers data by sending electromagnetic energy across miles of air to a receiver, you definitely don\u2019t design it in a way where 20% of the mass that it will be moving through absorbs some of its energy. Why? Cause that degrades the signal. 5G wouldn\u2019t work or it would have super shitty service if it actually heated up oxygen molecules.", "created_utc": 1586216140.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmn1bt6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmjtidb", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmn1bt6", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmn1bt6/"}
