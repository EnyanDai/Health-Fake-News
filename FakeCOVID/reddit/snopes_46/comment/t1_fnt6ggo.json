The Oscar-nominated actor was promoting his 2011 flick Rampart and decided an AMA would make for great publicity. Bad idea. Harrelson (or his PR team) didn't seem to understand that when you host an AMA, you are technically agreeing to answer questions about literally anything. Whenever someone would ask about Harrelson's life or about any subject other than Rampart, he would brusquely change topics and ask everyone to \"focus on the film.\"\n\n>The backlash was swift, with commenters deeming Harrelson as a diva who was probably letting his PR team answer questions for him. In Reddit lore, Harrelson's AMA goes down in history as the worst of all time.\n\nhttps://mashable.com/2014/03/27/worst-reddit-amas/?europe=true\n\nYou can find a bunch of articles which give a similar write-up. \n\n> Stop defending internet trolls and their false accusations. \n\nCan you please point out where I have defended internet trolls.", "created_utc": 1587235528.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnt6ggo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnt5j6n", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnt6ggo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnt6ggo/"}
