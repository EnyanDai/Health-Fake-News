As if they plan to be against the establishment and let nothing hinder them? Like they're their own little society?\n\nAll I see is a majority of people too willing to accept a single (evolving) narrative and allow that narrative to state that all other narratives are false. \n\n\"You don't believe in God, because my God is the only God. Your interpretation of God is wrong. You are a heathen.\"\n\nThis isn't religion, though, it's science. Experts in medicine are used on TV to encourage interventions of great scale (all of them) yet if an expert comes forth and opposes that narrative - they're a terrorist, they want anarchy, people to die, and they also don't care about being wrong or responsible for others' deaths. Also no problem with putting their careers and livelihoods at stake.\n\nIs that REALLY what you think?\n\nI think there is no debate because there is no debate being allowed. Therefor our understanding is not priority, our course of action is. Our understanding, though, tells us that we're in grave danger so we must act. \n\nMake sense?
