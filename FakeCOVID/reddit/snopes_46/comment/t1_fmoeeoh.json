Sort of catchy.\n\nClimate change denial is something that drives me up the wall. Because as someone who's really looked into it, it seems to be..... well, basically \"rumor on steroids\". People show that 'tribalism' thing and simply \"only believe people who are my peers\".\n\nThe right is now an emotional movement where people see themselves as part of a group, and only things said in this group \"is the truth\".\n\nIt's fucking horrible to witness. You see people spreading random lies and propaganda about climate science, and if their MS Paint graphs they've done themselves isn't good enough, they just lie, because they've been conditioned to. Imagine being so brainwashed you think it's right to come up with lies about any climate science you see?\n\nToday Sweden's meteorological institute showed that Sweden was warming much faster than the rest of the world (part because land mass warms faster, and part because we're closer to the north pole, which also warms faster).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/svtnyheter/status/1247391520803688454\n\nThe twitter comments are just pure............ trash. People basically screaming at this institute for daring to say something that \"goes against the right\".\n\nStop the planet.
