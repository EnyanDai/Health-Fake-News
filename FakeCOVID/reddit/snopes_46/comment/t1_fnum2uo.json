The majority suggest that further analysis and studies be done. The data is too insignificant to come to any conclusion. As with the gliomas, they said it could be considered a possible carcinogen but the data was relatively insignificant. It\u2019s worth noting that correlation does not equal causation. There have to be many things considered and drastic studies to narrow something down as carcinogenic. There are just too many differing and contradicting factors to show any relevant evidence of adverse effects in humans.\n\nI\u2019m not saying EMF radiation is without problems. It is known to interfere with animals and insects. Also, 5G networks can greatly undermine the accuracy of weather forecasting as the resonance of water (used by satellites to determine moisture content) is similar to those used by 5G. Workarounds and compromises are being developed to counteract the latter. However, there is not enough statistical evidence to suggest these radio towers are of any threat to us. \n\n[The American Cancer Society\u2019s response](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/extremely-low-frequency-radiation.html)", "created_utc": 1587265359.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnum2uo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntvlbb", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnum2uo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnum2uo/"}
