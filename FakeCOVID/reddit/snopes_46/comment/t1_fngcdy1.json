Because of this, people's default reaction is basically \"OH GOD, WE'RE GETTING MICROWAVED!\" Well no, not really. These are still wavelengths that are safely just above the spectrum of actual microwave radiation, and provided that the [FCC actually does it's job](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/wireless-devices-and-health-concerns), should not provide long-term harm for anyone.\n\nBut 5G technology does have some of it's own unique challenges.\n\nFirst: Because the wavelengths are extremely short, 5G technology relies more on relays and other sub-transmitters to [effectively penetrate walls and other barriers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/annatobin/2018/05/25/could-5g-have-trouble-penetrating-buildings/#5af4a2779f97) to reach networks. I've read somewhere that new technologies are in the process of being developed to make 5G transmitters more efficient and able to be cast through solid objects more easily, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nSecond: People are extremely paranoid about ANY new technology that is being rolled out, especially if there's a lack of understanding about how it actually works. This is a big one, potentially much bigger than the first problem for obvious reasons. This is exactly why I say we need to develop more public awareness about what 5G technology actually is, how it works, and how it should be handled by the general public. It's not \\*unreasonable\\* to be afraid of radiation in and of itself, but treating everyday technologies this way is silly and will prevent progress in transmission science further down the line.", "created_utc": 1586928019.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngcdy1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "score": -6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngcdy1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngcdy1/"}
