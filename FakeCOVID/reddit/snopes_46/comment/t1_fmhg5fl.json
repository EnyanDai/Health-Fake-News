Jones rarely actually mentioned his conspiracy theories and never had a very large fans base who actually took him seriously.\n\n>Maybe it's just personal experience then but almost all 9/11 truthers I've ever met were strongly right-wing.\n\nI mean we could go round in circles. Unless you have evidence of that this is meaningless.\n\n>Wow gonna have to disagree with you there, I'm pretty sure the far right has had a monopoly on anti-semite conspiracies for the past 60 or so years now.\n\nWow that's quite a statement! What is this based on apart from the media telling you so?\n\nThe last large scale, serious anti-Semitic government was under the far left Soviet Union.\n\nThere have been quite a few anti-Semitic far left governments outside of Europe since then - Robert Mugabe springs to mind. Fairly sure the Red Army Faction and the Japanese Red Army were other violent groups who were anti-Semitic.\n\nThere is a huge current problem with anti-Semitism amongst the UK left at the moment.\n\nFor one out of many examples and studies: \n\nhttps://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/antisemitism-on-the-far-left-has-overtaken-antisemitism-on-the-far-right-according-to-research-1.493759\n\n>All left wingers? All of them? Are you sure you're not being a little hyperbolic? Everyone left of centre is a radical conspiracist? I'm not even sure what radical conspiracies you can have on 'gender', so that's news to me\n\nYes a little bit hyperbolic. But yes most nowadays do, including in academia. I've seen it pushed in many universities I've studied and worked at.", "created_utc": 1586078760.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmhg5fl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_furdeu", "parent_id": "t1_fmemhf4", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmhg5fl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/furdeu/masts_set_on_fire_over_false_5g_coronavirus_claims/fmhg5fl/"}
