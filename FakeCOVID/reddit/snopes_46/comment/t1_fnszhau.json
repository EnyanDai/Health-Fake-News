Trust in official sources, authorities, and experts so low, something that looks *purposefully* amateurish is actually more believable? It's a twisted version of our worship of the underdog, the rebel, the freedom fighter. If 99% of scientists say one thing, and 1% says another, for example, it's not that the 99% know what they're doing and the 1% is an idiot; it's that the 1% is an oppressed voice speaking up for the truth against a majority that's in cahoots to silence them. It's no coincidence that so many of these people will often reference symbolism from movies like The Matrix (the red pill) and V for Vendetta (the Guy Fawkes mask). Hell, that shit is all over our popular culture. We even have a myth that Christopher Columbus was one such rebellious visionnaire fighting against a close-minded establishment. Nevermind that in fact Columbus was himself a dumbass hack following pseudoscientific notions, that everyone knew not only that the Earth was round, but its *true* size, and thus knew that if there was nothing between Europe and Asia Columbus would have starved along the way. That's why no one wanted to fund his stupid trip. Columbus was the one who bought in some \"alternative\" theory claiming that the Earth was much smaller. He simply was the luckiest motherfucker in the history of mankind that there actually was a whole undiscovered continent right midway between Europe and Asia.", "created_utc": 1587231737.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnszhau", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnsbrmr", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587231933.0, "name": "t1_fnszhau", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnszhau/"}
