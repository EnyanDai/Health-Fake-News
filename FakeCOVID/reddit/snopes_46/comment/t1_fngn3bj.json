Its everywhere. The media is also giving it exposure. Most people that are into conspiracies reject the 5g rona saying its the stupidest shit and ive heard many call it cringy.\n\nSo now we have the decent minded people and the deep conspiracy theorists rejecting the 5gRona non sense. Why is this spreading?? How is it gaining traction?? What is the real purpose one could have to spread a fake conspiracy?? The braindead class of zombies are eating it up. Is this to distract from other conspiracies? Is it an effort to make veteran theorists look in more crazy? Is this some troll put together from the bois at /pol or /b. Is this just the age old technology fear coupled with many people suddenly having a lot of free time?\n\nI have so many questions but my gut feeling is this whole conspiracy is premeditated and has a purpose. I feel like it is to either discredit or distract. I generally think rationally and from an optimistic pov but i feel worst case is this could be a bigger plot where quite a few conspiracies over the last few years have been fabricated to make western society loose faith in their countrys systems and start to revolt causing revolution then an outside party swoops in and takes over or everything gets melted down into a one world system where those in charge are corrupt from the get go.", "created_utc": 1586937706.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngn3bj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1gtim", "parent_id": "t1_fnfrnyp", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngn3bj", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/australia/comments/g1gtim/5g_and_antivax_conspiracy_theorists_are/fngn3bj/"}
