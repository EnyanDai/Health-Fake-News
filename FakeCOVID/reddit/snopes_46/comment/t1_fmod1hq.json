(For more information on the IARC classification system, see Known and Probable Human Carcinogens.) IARC also noted that exposure to the brain from RF fields from cell phone base stations (mounted on roofs or towers) is less than 1/100th the exposure to the brain from mobile devices such as cell phones.  \n\nWhich leads us to the matter of cell phones rather than the towers themselves (after all, most people are  \ncloser to devices than towers).\n\nThe text cites also several times study results which support that radiation might be a probably cause  \nof cancer, but the opposite as well - bbut all of them seem to have been either too limited, not being verified,  \nnot being tested over a long run or on humans, so there is no solid conclusion for either opinion.\n\nAnd *that* is what i m saying: pretending that anyone who doesnt feel sure about this is akin to  \nflatearthers certainly feeds into the distrust among those who are already open game for  \nconspiracy spreaders but not only among those easy-misguided.", "created_utc": 1586254453.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmod1hq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmn54pe", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmod1hq", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmod1hq/"}
