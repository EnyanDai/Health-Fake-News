Blast enough microwaves in one area and you can kill organic life because of its dependence on water to function, or at the very least make it uncomfortable to be in the area. Not saying these conspiracy theorists have the right idea, but advancement in microwave technology could have effects beyond our control if governments have the ability to focus on an area with microwave-based tech and blast it with microwaves to kill, isolate targets, torture people in mass, etc. It's not a joke. \n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active\\_Denial\\_System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System) \n\nJust because governments aren't involved in full-scale warfare to the best of their abilities does not mean that they are not actively engaging in research and development into furthering the interests of the nation they represent. China and the United States are big players in this continuous competition to be the best. Maybe microwaves didn't cause COVID-19 and 5G isn't something to be worried about now. The studies that come from COVID-19 and the research being done in 5G may not just be for the benefit of the people, in terms of faster internet speeds. It may be the scaling of military research and development into microwave-based weaponry. I recommend Neil Degrasse Tyson's \"Accessory to War\". It opened my eyes quite a bit to how impressive government R&D really is, and why they can't tell people about a lot of it. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I just believe the US military has no good reason to tell us what they're doing because everyone else is competing to be the best, and telling the public their secrets would constantly level the playing field, which is counterproductive.", "created_utc": 1586139712.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmjxg9e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "score": -4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmjxg9e", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmjxg9e/"}
