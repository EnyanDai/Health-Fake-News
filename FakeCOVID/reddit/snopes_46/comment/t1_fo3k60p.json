We traveled the world, he always had his head on his shoulders. But i remember even as a kid he always believed or read articles on aliens, any modern conspiracy he was on it. He would talk about it to friends but at the end of the day he was as normal dad as can be. It was his past time activity to read that crap. \n\nMedia is a powerful drug and just because someone got super excited over it and got into it real deep, saying someone is mentally unstable due to their new beliefs is pushing it. Sounds more like the son wants to get his dad in a retirement home.\n\nThe guy believes in 5G conspiracy...like a million others. Same as when 10 years ago everyone was screaming Illuminati! So we got to a point where we are going to burn people at the stake again because of a political belief? Its terrible where this world is heading if people have to hide what they think about some stupid 5G.", "created_utc": 1587488260.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo3k60p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "parent_id": "t1_fo3i0u4", "score": -8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo3k60p", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/AskDocs/comments/g5fyvm/my_very_smart_dad_has_recently_started_reading/fo3k60p/"}
