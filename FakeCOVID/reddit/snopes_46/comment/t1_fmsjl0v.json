But the allusion that some people believe that can cause people to think that 5g towers are most likely harmless because the opposing view is crazy. When in fact 5g towers may be causing some harm that isnt yet known and if you question it you look like a nut. Ive seen many pictures and videos of animals dying near 5g towers and ive seen post after post about headaches near 5g towers. Today, if you question health risks of 5g you look like an idiot, yet most countries had worries about it long before the 5g coronavirus story became mainstream. THAT is the real conspiracy. News stories that are completely crazy to keep people away from discussing a legitimate issue.", "created_utc": 1586356749.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmsjl0v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmsjl0v", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmsjl0v/"}
