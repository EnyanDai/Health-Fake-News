In other words, orders of magnitude higher frequency. This hits your skin and your eyes every single day, 24/7. \n\nLook up ionization thresholds and how electromagnetic waves would hurt a biological system, find the actual physics behind how electromagnetic waves could even cause biological damage. These are established quantities and well mapped out ideas. It's the same sort of math that lets us know why dropping a kitten on a steel beam won't break it, because **the numbers literally make it impossible**. \n\nYou can throw your hands up and say science doesn't know everything and you've heard people say things, but the same people raising concerns about this stuff are the same ignorant people that are vaccine deniers and all, so you know what camp you'll be in.", "created_utc": 1587251867.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnu00ha", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntxknh", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnu00ha", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnu00ha/"}
