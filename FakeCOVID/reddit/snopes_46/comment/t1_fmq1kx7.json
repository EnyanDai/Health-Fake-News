It\u2019s one thing to call out someone for purposefully and knowingly lying to people, fuck those people. But when someone is simply stating a fact that is *thought* to be common knowledge, they don\u2019t deserve to be talked to in the way you are talking to this guy. Obviously, that guy and many, many, many other people, myself included, have never read that article you linked. Furthermore, the vast majority of us have probably been told this particular bit of information most of our lives.\n\nYou talking down to a person who simply did not know a (mostly) unknown bit of information does more to make people think you are a rude jerk, than actually teach people new information. \n\nAnd before you try to say you were calling him out for \u201clying\u201d to people, unknowingly passing on knowledge that most \u201cknew\u201d but is actually not true, is NOT lying. Lying means \u201cto make a false statement with the intention to deceive,\u201d and when people say this about yelling fire in a theater, they are not trying to deceive people. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTL;DR: you were being unnecessarily rude.", "created_utc": 1586291206.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmq1kx7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwkcwo", "parent_id": "t1_fmp8txx", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmq1kx7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwkcwo/youtube_tightens_rules_after_david_icke_5g/fmq1kx7/"}
