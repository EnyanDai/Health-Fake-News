Real life conspiracies are **never** ideologically motivated. Real life conspiracy theories don't involve this many separate actors from different parts of life. Real life conspiracies hardly even ever involve prominent public figures; conspiracies are more likely to be carried out by bureaucrats, intelligence agencies, and/or members of a corporation.\n\nLike, you want to look at the real world examples of an effort to depopulate the undesirables? [How about the thousands of poor black women who were involuntarily sterilized without their consent?](https://archive.org/details/poorwomenpowerfu00ward). \"Testimony revealed that many of these women were threatened with an end to their welfare benefits unless they consented to sterilization\". There's a real life conspiracy right there that we have plenty of information on. There's senate hearings, there's books, there's victims we can interview.\n\n>On June 14, 1973, two black girls, Minnie Lee and Mary Alice Relf, ages fourteen and twelve, respectively, were sterilized without their knowledge in Alabama by the Montgomery Community Action Committee, an OEO-financed organization\n\n>Between the span of the 1930's to the 1970's, nearly one-third of the female population in Puerto Rico was sterilized; at the time, this was the highest rate of sterilization in the world.\n\nSo why is it that none of these conspiracy theorists give a shit about this? Every conspiracy theorist knows about MK Ultra, despite that program having far fewer victims than the history of officially sponsored eugenics in the United States. Could it be that MK Ultra had some white male victims, whereas the government targeting poor minorities doesn't really bother you?", "created_utc": 1588901746.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptzzc5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptiyns", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptzzc5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptzzc5/"}
