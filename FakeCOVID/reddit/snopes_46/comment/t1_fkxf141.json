When challenged, that belief has already been integrated into a person\u2019s thinking and informs how they look at information in the first place. The natural reaction is to protect the existing belief.\n\nSo the strategy is not to use the truth to combat the false belief, but to just dismantle the false belief by itself. The trouble with this, of course, is that the more knowledgeable folk try to point out rational problems with how different aspects of science work. Per your example that 5G has nothing to do with viruses, the scientifically ignorant person can\u2019t put that together because they a) know little about viruses, and b) know little about radiation.\n\nSo go dystopian on them. Agree to agree, suggesting you\u2019ll see if you can change your thinking, and then go with logical consequences. \u201cIf 5G can do that, then 4G must be just as bad. Let\u2019s put our phones in the microwave.\u201d - \u201cWait, microwaves use light, too? We better put the microwave in the basement with a blanket over it.\u201d - \u201cJust to be safe, we better close all the curtains and turn out the lights.\u201d \n\nBasically, cause the believer to make increasingly stupid choices that follow from their false belief until the cognitive dissonance is too much to bear. Push them toward full blown OCD behaviour. Eventually they have to reject the false belief because it makes their life so inconvenient and makes them do a million stupid things.\n\nNever underestimate the power of human laziness as a motivational tool.\n\nEdit: thanks for the silver!\n\nEdit edit: thanks for the gold!
