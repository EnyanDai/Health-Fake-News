Its not the 1980s anymore. \n\nThe 1980s were not the last time we needed 3 watt cell phone boosters, as we still use them even today. Also, the 1980s Motorola cellphone was $4000 msrp, which is over $9,000 today. Practically no one had cellphones in the 1980s and few had them in the 1990s.\n\n>Using this as arguments against the implementation of 5G is nonsensical.\n\nI quoted a scientific study showing there are effects. Then you pivoted. I provided more real world products that go against your pivot. Now you're stating these are \"nonsensical.\"\n\nAgain, I ask:  Do you have a link to any study that states there are no effects of microwave technology on the human body?", "created_utc": 1587225988.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsox8i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnsnbvz", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnsox8i", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnsox8i/"}
