For a low information person this could easily be attributed to \"microwaves\" or the nano-bots infesting youre mouth, nose, brain, or some other such thing. Combine that with extremely high levels of anxiety, and peoples natural instinct to try to find something physical that they can \"attack\" to save themselves and their families and you get this phenomenon.\n\nThis virus hits people so hard so quickly for intermittent amounts of time that in my experience it almost feels like someone simply \"turns on a switch, then turns off a switch.\" You literally feel just a bit sick one minute with a cough, then can hardly stand or breath the next second, and it goes away as quickly as is comes. It unironically feels like being \"attacked\" by some invisible weapon.\n\nALSO AND VERY IMPORTANTLY THAT I RARELY HEAR MENTIONED, there could be a sustained campaign of misinformation meant to further cripple essential services, such as communications, which is incredibly important to a functioning society. This could be done by foreign hostile powers, or just plain old psychopaths who want to watch the world burn.\n\nI get you all want to mock these people, but mental health and fear are a hell of a drug...", "created_utc": 1586273523.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmp34ph", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwjw93", "parent_id": "t3_fwjw93", "score": 24, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmp34ph", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwjw93/completely_absurd_scientists_condemn_crazy/fmp34ph/"}
