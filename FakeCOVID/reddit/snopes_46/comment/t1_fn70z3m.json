Like let\u2019s say i have a tower transmitting near my house...near my kids room. Wouldn\u2019t that negatively impact my child in the long run? There\u2019s been cases of cancers of on body parts where phones were most likely located. I don\u2019t know the exact study but here\u2019s this one that outlines how cell phone radiation can decrease sperm count and potentially influences cancers in the long term. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776019/\nThe WHO classifies phone radiation as a potential carcinogen and yet 5g towers are being put near every corner.  3g and 4g towers were also problematic and now we have 5g on top of everything. And on top of that we have cosmic radiation. There\u2019s so much radiation everywhere and we know it has an impact on our biological systems. I remember when the tobacco industry, food industry, and all these other industries muddied the science in order to make profit and used the government to influence laws and change public perception. It wasn\u2019t until years later when the effects were tangible and cancers and other health effects where causal to tobacco smoke. Wasn\u2019t it a few years back that we hated Ajit Pai on reddit. Now we forgot about that and happily support big telecommunication companies to rollout 5g on every street block.", "created_utc": 1586711177.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn70z3m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fn5ua69", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn70z3m", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fn70z3m/"}
