It's a thing. But i don't think its dangerous to humans from afar.\n\nRadiation is radio waves. The same radio waves we are exposed to every day as we tune our station to 102jamz or am sports radio or use our cell phone to make a call. And in each of those cases you are dealing with a certain frequency spectrum (FM/AM etc)\n\n* in the case of 5g they are going higher up the spectrum closer to military track radars. If you are on a military unit they say you must stay 1000 foot away from the transmitter *(but its at very high power output) in this case it will be at lower power output but it will be beaming your ass all day long.\n\nIs it dangerous? Hell i dont know. But i am certain its more dangerous than listening to the radio. And less dangerous than putting your head inside the microwave oven.\n\nQuestion is where does it fall on that scale?
