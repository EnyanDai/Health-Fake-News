I did look it up. I even watched an hour long video by some lady at the University of Melbourne. All she did was list off ways 5G *might* affect people's health. And pretty much all of what she said made it clear she didn't understand what she was talking about. At times it was so bad it was hard to watch. \n\nAnd the worst thing was the people in the comments didn't seem capable of making critical inferences about the plausibility of the things she was saying. As far as I can tell, the state of education is such that the vast majority of people can't tell when they're being bullshitted.\n\nSo, the only way I can tell whether this is real is to learn about it and make a judgment based on known physics and chemistry. All I need is a quick explanation of the mechanism by which you guys are claiming 5G is harmful. Because as a physics grad student who majored in both physics and chemistry, I can't think of a plausible mechanism. Individual photons in that wavelength aren't powerful enough to cause chemical effects, and the amount of energy isn't enough to cause thermal effects either. That's pretty much it as far as mechanisms go.", "created_utc": 1586145009.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmk5fjd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvffw5", "parent_id": "t1_fmj1h6b", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmk5fjd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fvffw5/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmk5fjd/"}
