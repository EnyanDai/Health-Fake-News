Indeed, researchers continue to conduct studies. One recent study was released by the\u00a0National Toxicology Program\u00a0(NTP), an agency run by the Department of Health and Human Services. In this widely quoted study about\u00a0cell phone radio frequency radiation, scientists found that high exposure to 3G RFR led to some cases of cancerous heart tumors, brain tumors, and tumors in the adrenal glands of male rats.\n\nThe study is a good object lesson in how hard it is to do science like this. As\u00a0RealClearScience\u00a0points out, the number of tumors detected were so small that they statistically could have occurred by chance (which may be more likely since they were only detected in male subjects). Moreover, the level and duration of the RFR exposure were well in excess of what any actual human would ever be exposed to, and in fact, the irradiated test rats lived longer than the unexposed control rats. Says Dr. Novella, \u201cExperienced researchers look at a study like that and say that doesn\u2019t really tell us anything.\u201d\"", "created_utc": 1588896360.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptqqfw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptoekr", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptqqfw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptqqfw/"}
