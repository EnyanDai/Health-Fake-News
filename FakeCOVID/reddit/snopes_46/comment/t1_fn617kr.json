But even with 5G largely untested in comparison to tech using older frequencies, I think it's pretty safe to say that non-thermal effects of EMF _in general_ are proven to exist. \n\nYet we continue to set SAR levels based on dated standards. Additionally, young kids are using smartphones now with WiFi, bluetooth, NFC, 4G data all on, all the time - and their skulls are thinner. But of course we only test SAR levels using a _model_ of a thicker adult skull. Pair this with increasing heavy metal exposure in early life through various environmental vectors - you know that iron filing and magnet demo kids see early on in science class?\n\nSo my personal opinion is that we don't need to continue adding more types of EMF sources to our environment, \"progress\" be damned. You need more speed, you plug it in. What's so hard about that?\n\nBut surveillance capitalism would sure thrive if it does happen. Until it stops thriving and needs yet more data collection vectors. Neuralink anyone? Imagine the gliomas an implanted transmitter could cause, potentially even on remote command. Little bump in power here, beamforming over there, who knows?
