That means there will be 50x more towers put up to satisfy the same demand as 4G, which can travel up to 10 miles. I think rather than having the approach \u201cwe should use it until it\u2019s proven unsafe\u201d is highly dangerous. I think that we have, collectively, failed repeatedly at introducing a wide scope of products & materials, etc, with consequences we could have anticipated with more studies & research on a real world scale. Not how we do it now, where it is being globally deployed in a race to stay relevant in the market, or to capitalize on opportunity immediately. The instant gratification that has developed in our culture applies at a scale that can have a huge impact. Not to mention 5G as a technology is silly for consumer usage & many people in the industry agree. Mostly due to the limitations described above. A better investment would be fiber optic infrastructure for all households & schools so 10gb/s is a reality within 5 years.", "created_utc": 1586037924.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmfz6xk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t1_fmfxrlh", "score": -2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmfz6xk", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmfz6xk/"}
