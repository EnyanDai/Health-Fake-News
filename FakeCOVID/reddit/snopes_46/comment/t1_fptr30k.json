That's the majority of incidents that the article discussed, save one guy spitting on a worker and *possibly* infecting him with covid, which could be a bit stronger penalty for sure, but mostly this is just mentally disturbed people being manipulated into doing stupid mostly non-violent civil disobedience.\n\nI would say the vast majority of yelling incidents should provoke no more than a cop saying \"move along\" to them. Vandalism is already an established crime with clear punishments. Court-mandated counselling for thought crimes doesn't strike me as a good solution, though I do believe these people likely need a lot of counselling. Too bad in the US they can't afford it.\n\nAlso note that \"people getting manipulated into doing stupid things\" is going to become more and more prevalent with the advance of surveillance capitalism and public manipulation through social media. So here you have one of the first instances, and it's not clear there's actual astroturf-style manipulation going on so much as crazies in their own echo chambers, but for sure actual manipulated \"terrorism\" is going to happen eventually, and they'll take the mentally weak and paranoid and militarize them against our societies.\n\nSo what are you going to do? Start throwing the book at these people and turn ever more into a police state to counter such threats? How much of our fundamental rights gets thrown in the trash in the process? That's the path others in this chain are opting for. More jails, more authority.
