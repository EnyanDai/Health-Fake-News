Besides that there isn\u2019t much to do for infected people anyway, those who are should stay at home until their immune system fights it off.\n\nLike I said I can\u2019t speak for hospitals elsewhere, but I noticed that many people don\u2019t go to the hospital when it can be postponed and isn\u2019t that important. Together with the fact that many hospitals clear themselves out so that they have space in case things get worse, the hospitals are indeed emptier than usual.\n\nOn the other hand I understand what you want to say with the news photos. They are dumb and usually don\u2019t represent the reality, mostly just stockphotos. Not just with the Corona topic, but in general. Sometimes indeed to kinda make the topic more visual interesting and understandable on the first look, but usually not to fool and stress you on purpose.
