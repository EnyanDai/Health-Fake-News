It's one of the very reasons I came here, I simply cannot be doing with all the fake news, it drives me nuts!! \n\nIf I read something and it sounds questionable or would have an impact to me personally, first thing I do is have a quick google to see what the crack is. I don't just check the first website, I'll have a quick scout and use my common sense as to what is plausible etc\n\nBut there are people who believe because it was on facebook, that's it, it's the god given truth. I had a friend freak out as she found a fake status that said ASDA were only allowing adults in, no children, so if you were a single guardian, you'd be screwed. She was having an utter meltdown!\n\nNow logic tells me, this can't be true, as if supermarkets would stop a single parent buying food for their family, I just can't see it happening. But i have to give the benefit of the doubt and did a little research. Turns out, just as i suspected, utter BS and ASDA were getting sick of the hate, just from one Karen spreading her lies!", "created_utc": 1586114204.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmipdrr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmi5pc2", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmipdrr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmipdrr/"}
