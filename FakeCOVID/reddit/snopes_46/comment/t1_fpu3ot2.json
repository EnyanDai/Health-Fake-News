Flatearthers embody the essence of that battle. They transcend the oppression of reason by abandoning it altogether in a regressive mode of healing and collective grief. Their struggle underscores the power of madness as the only way to forget or erase traumatic experiences of the past.\n\n> The growing appeal of crackpots of various kind and magnitude has become so pervasive that these characters have infiltrated the American mainstream. They occupy positions of influence at universities, in media, think tanks, government, politics and the White House \u2014 especially there where, after more than three years of relentless adverse selection, they have become practically sole occupants. Their emergence and widespread acceptance are the result of a quest for simple certainty by people who find themselves lost and bewildered by the growing complexity of their life and the grim reality in general.\n\n> These crackpots have a special appeal to a growing population of what H. L. Mencken calls *the inferior men. The inferior man hates knowledge because it is complex \u2013it puts an unbearable burden upon his capacity for thinking.* He has an insatiable need for trivial simplicity, always ready to trade probable truths for palpable falsehoods. *The science of cosmology is complex; it\u2019s understanding requires an immense stock of knowledge and a habit of thought. But cosmology of Genesis, although idiotic, is so simple that everyone can grasp it. It is set forth in a few phrases. It offers to an ignorant man the irresistible reasonableness of the nonsensical*.", "created_utc": 1588903983.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpu3ot2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt3j2w", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1588904391.0, "name": "t1_fpu3ot2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpu3ot2/"}
