The radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation that mobile phones or phone masts transmit and receive is non-ionising and is very weak. This non-ionising radiation does not have enough energy to damage DNA and cannot directly cause cancer.    \n\nPlease lookup ionising and non-ionising radiation. \n\nPeople test the mother-loving shit out of this stuff these days, asbestos was never tested or even thought about being dangerous, you can't cover this up anymore or use an example from 60 years ago.\n\nSure people didn't think smoking caused cancer, but then again there were no scientists testing for it. Scientists, universities and medical professionals now specifically test for carcinogens in pretty much everything.
