In France where heads were rolling? In Russia under the czar? During the Russian revolution? During the labor struggles, which were incredibly violent and suppressive all over the world?\n\n>there\u2019s been much more freedom of speech over the past couple of hundred of years than in the previous 2,000.\n\nThat's highly debatable because in the previous 2000 years, your speech could only reach those in your immediate vicinity, and as the printing press and other inventions came into place; speech became amplified, but so did the suppression of said speech. \n\nFree speech is a pretty new phenomenon, it's really only been around in it's present form for the second half of the 20th century. Especially given it's not even built into most constitution, and in the US it's only a prior restrain law - meaning the government can't stop you from speaking your bit; but there's nothing in there that says the government can arrest you afterwards. This is how speech law was interpreted in the US before WWII.", "created_utc": 1589916609.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr5y4b9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr5tfa8", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr5y4b9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr5y4b9/"}
