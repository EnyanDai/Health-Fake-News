I too don't understand why there is so much opposition to raising concerns. Asking for further testing on new technology is not the same as shouting that an apocalypse is coming and for everyone to go hide out indefinitely in their underground bunkers. \n\nMaking sure of the safety of technology that is about to cover a huge amount of the population is the minimum that can be done, yet that is not happening at all. Science will never reach  a definite conclusion, to say that testing is not necessary because radiation is understood is very ignorant and dangerous. Everything needs to be questioned and tested. And even when tested, it's important to ask who conducted the testing and how.\n\nThere are documentaries on \"cancer clusters\" in the UK of up to 70% of the population of a town developing cancer or some other harmful illnesses as a result of living too close to a cell tower. And guess who financially backed those that conducted testing on the safety of the towers? The telecom industry.\n\nIt does no harm to ethically conduct safety tests thoroughly and repeatedly. It does, however, do great harm to assume everything will be fine and to question nothing.", "created_utc": 1586125078.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj8b7g", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t1_fmifs94", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj8b7g", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmj8b7g/"}
