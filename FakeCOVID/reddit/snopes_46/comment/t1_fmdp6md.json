Hardell](https://www.jrseco.com/re-analysis-by-hardell-of-interphone-study-on-cancer-brain-tumors-from-mobile-phone-use/),  Professor of Oncology at \u00d6rebro University in Sweden. He states: \u201cThe  telecom industry is trying to roll out technology that may have very  real, unintended harmful consequences. Scientific studies, both recently  and over many years, have identified harmful effects on health when  testing wireless products under realistic conditions. We are very  concerned that the increase in radiation exposure by 5G leads to damage  that cannot be reversed\u201d.\n\nHardell: \u201cThe fifth generation (5G) of  radio frequency radiation is now being developed. This is done without  dosimetric determination or study of the possible health effects. The  media praise in particular all the possibilities that this technology  promises to offer, such as the self-propelled car and Internet of Things  (IoT). The consequences for the health of humans, plants and animals  are not discussed at all. Politicians, governments and the media are  responsible for unbalanced information. Ordinary people are not informed  of conflicting opinions about this technological development. Health  effects from radio frequency radiation are a non issue in the media, at  least in Sweden, but also in most other countries\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-cell-phone-radiation-testing-20190821-72qgu4nzlfda5kyuhteiieh4da-story.html](https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-cell-phone-radiation-testing-20190821-72qgu4nzlfda5kyuhteiieh4da-story.html)\n\nTest of phones revealing reported Electromagnetic Radiation levels were up to 5 times higher than manufacturers reports\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - ohh look, down-voted without addressing my points", "created_utc": 1585973789.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmdp6md", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuetsu", "parent_id": "t3_fuetsu", "score": -15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585985289.0, "name": "t1_fmdp6md", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fuetsu/broadband_engineers_threatened_due_to_5g/fmdp6md/"}
