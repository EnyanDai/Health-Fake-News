Either it is all 5G or it is all virus.  I see no reason why 5G cannot enhance the effects of a virus.\n\nWe could be getting a glimpse at the future immune system problems that 5G saturation will create.  Hard to say for sure since industry and government specifically have ignored calls for safety testing (at least in the USA).  It is full speed ahead, based on pure assumptions (assuming since it is sub-thermal and non-ionizing it must be safe)\n\nIt should be noted 5G is increasing frequencies of both the 3-4G range and new high range of frequencies.  \n\n\\> First there is Frequency Range 1 (FR1)[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_NR_frequency_bands#cite_note-1)  that includes sub-6GHz frequency bands, some of which are bands  traditionally used by previous standards, but has been extended to cover  potential new spectrum offerings from 410 MHz to 7125 MHz.
