An abrupt personality change like this is not normal. Your father needs more than a little fresh air and to turn off the TV. Not that that is not good advice for us all! \n\nGiven his diagnoses of Diabetes, hypertension, and liver issues, he is likely on more than a few prescription meds. This personality change could be related to dosages, or a build-up of medications in his system because his liver and kidneys are not metabolizing them efficiently. \n\nAnxiety regarding global issues is a layer of stress that could certainly exacerbate underlying physiological issues. But anxiety in itself can cause delusional thinking. \n\nHe may be resistant, but it is vitally important for him to see his primary MD as soon as possible. If not in person, a telemedicine visit would probably suffice. \n\nMy father is brilliant, self-aware, and very science-minded. If he had a sudden personality change like this I would be astounded and deeply concerned. \n\nDon\u2019t let it go. This will not get better on its own. I\u2019m really sorry. Your dad is young!
