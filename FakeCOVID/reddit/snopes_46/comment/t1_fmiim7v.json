You should understand conjecture before jumping to your idiotic conclusions.\n\n> And it's the word people always use to make these things sound scarier to the uninformed. \n\nIts literally a general term. Informed people aren't alarmed when people use it. You are showing you are uninformed.\n\n> 5G sits inside the microwave band. The same band that's had both higher energy and lower energy waves used for various functions for years. \n\nThe simple microwave argument...this is what shows me your understanding is lacking. Are microwaves PERPETUALLY 24/7 emitting a high level of radiation or only when they are on? Is the focus of the radiation the microwaves emit generally contained WITHIN the microwave..yes. Word of advice...never use the microwave argument to try to prove your point. \n\n> And anyway, it all sits in the spectrum below visible light, the whole of which has been never been shown to do any damage at low energies. \n\nUhhh....no there are tons of articles out there that show it has an effect but they dont know how it exactly does it.   [https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/radiofrequency-radiation.html](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/radiofrequency-radiation.html) \n\n> Sure, I don't know off the top of my head if any studies have specifically been conducted on 5G towers, but they shouldn't need to anyway. This is hardly uncharted territory. \n\nSo you dont know yet you know?? You are saying they shouldnt need to even though they have shown both 2G and 3G to have some effects already.  \n\n>We understand the electromagnetic spectrum and have done thousands of studies on the effects of various parts of it over the years. \n\nNo sir, WE understand the electromagnetic spectrum and you obviously do not. I suggest you study up before jumping to say 5G does nothing.", "created_utc": 1586110311.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmiim7v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmidto8", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmiim7v", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmiim7v/"}
