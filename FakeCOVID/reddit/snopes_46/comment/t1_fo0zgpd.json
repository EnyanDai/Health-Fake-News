Then imagine the head of that cult having extreme amounts of influence and power while storing massive amounts hidden information that the majority of the rest of the world may never see. Oh, and they rape and molest children, spend billions to cover it up, then just shuffle people around and allow it to continue. That would be totally insane. At least he doesn't worship the zombie son of an invisible god who's leaders cover up their organization's child rape. \n\nThe point is different people have different beliefs about different things, some of those may seem ridiculous to others. I've never met anyone I agree with on everything, but that doesn't invalidate everything they say/believe by default. If you have concerns with specific information he is sharing on this topic, you should refute that information specifically, but don't ad hominem, that's not intellectually honest.", "created_utc": 1587422726.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo0zgpd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g4wkli", "parent_id": "t1_fo06du0", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo0zgpd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g4wkli/tv_stations_interview_with_5g_coronavirus/fo0zgpd/"}
