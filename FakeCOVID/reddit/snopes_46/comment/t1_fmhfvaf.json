They found 60 damaged trees that looked like they were having a bad day, and then measured the EM within a very narrow range (cell phone signals) near those unhappy trees. Any trees that had \u201cdamage patterns not attributable to diseases, pests or other environmental factors\u201d were excluded from study. \n\nThis is a classic example of seeking a bad thing, pointing to a thing you don\u2019t like, and saying there\u2019s a causal link between those. Are there no healthy trees in line of sight of cell phone towers? The study doesn\u2019t ask or evaluate. Are their possible other reasons why those trees may be sick? What if it\u2019s a different frequency? Or it\u2019s winter? How did they measure tree health? Etc. \n\n\nThe article ends with \u201cThe further deployment of phone masts has to be stopped.\u201d\nNever ever in a scientific paper would you see that kind of language. Even /if/ the trees were sick from cell phone signals, what are the costs of sick trees? Why only stop deployment? If the trees are really sick then we should remove all cell phone transmitters! Etc. \nThis paper is an option piece with shoddy statistics and no scientific rigor.", "created_utc": 1586078428.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmhfvaf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t1_fmhenjl", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmhfvaf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmhfvaf/"}
