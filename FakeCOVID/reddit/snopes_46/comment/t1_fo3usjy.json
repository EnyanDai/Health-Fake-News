This is happening all over, with people of all ages. I've done quite a bit of reading and based on that my understanding is that it's largely a response to anxiety about what is happening. People look for simple explanations and will grab onto whatever makes them feel better. Sometimes people also feel marginalized and unimportant, and feeling like they have the answers gives them a sense that they're important again.\n\nI'd suggest simply spending time talking with your dad and making him feel appreciated. Whenever he states conspiracy theories, it's good to calmly state the facts as you know them to give him a reality check. If he wants to get into an extended debate, realize that there is no winning such a debate with a conspiracy theorist. They arrived at their position for emotional reasons, not logical ones. Thus, I'd suggest focusing your efforts on the emotional side of things.", "created_utc": 1587493303.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo3usjy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "parent_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo3usjy", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskDocs/comments/g5fyvm/my_very_smart_dad_has_recently_started_reading/fo3usjy/"}
