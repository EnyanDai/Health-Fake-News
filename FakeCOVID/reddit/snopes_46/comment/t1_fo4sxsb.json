When I was younger (ages from around 14-17) I became somewhat obsessed with conspiracy theories and didn\u2019t think anything of it. It started with just an interest in 9/11 and things like that, but over the years I became increasingly paranoid about the government. I would cover up mirrors and my phone if I was getting dressed because I thought people COULD be watching me through. It wasn\u2019t that I believed it 100%, and I didn\u2019t feel intense anxiety about it like you see with psychosis patients. It was just that I felt way more comfortable doing it, it was sort of like a \u201cjust in case thing\u201d.\n\nWhen I was 17, I suffered from what I believe is a psychotic break due to extreme stress. ( I was doing difficult exams and my relationship with my peers was under strain.) I suffer with clinical depression and generalised anxiety, and have a family history of mental illness, but this was awful. The \u201cpsychosis\u201d lasted around a week and then completely went away.\n\nI would say, perhaps talk to your dad about it. Is he under any stress? Sometimes, voicing your concerns is a good thing to do. Hope this didn\u2019t seem too spammy, try not to worry unless it escalates!", "created_utc": 1587510594.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo4sxsb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "parent_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo4sxsb", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskDocs/comments/g5fyvm/my_very_smart_dad_has_recently_started_reading/fo4sxsb/"}
