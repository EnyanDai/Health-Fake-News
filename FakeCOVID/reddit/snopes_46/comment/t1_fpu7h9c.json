But once upon a time, Photoshop fit on five 3.5\" floppy disks. Software developers and content producers are lazy. Give them inexpensive space, and they will fill it. In ten years time, HD video is going to seem about as desirable as VHS.\n\nAlso, 5G is not just about speed,  it's about network capacity. Everyone and their uncle has a smartphone these days, but have you ever really been in a massive crowd when they all tried to use them at once? There's a reason convention centers and stadiums have massive WiFi meshes, and it's not because the cell signal strength is too weak.\n\nNetwork providers and consumer electronics manufacturers are also salivating over the idea of linking everything from your car to your coffee maker to the Internet. The Internet of Things, or IoT, as its called, will be nothing less than an astronomical expansion of connected devices and network nodes, doubtless with a whole new bundling and billing ecosystem to keep them all chattering away. Today's 4G spectrum and capacity won't cut it.", "created_utc": 1588906339.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpu7h9c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpu2ljp", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpu7h9c", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpu7h9c/"}
