It happens everywhere. Everyone has emotions and a consequent opinion on the news. We care about the things happening in our world.\n\nI'll give you an example of what we were discussing:\n\nTittle on Reuters: \"Putins alleged meddling in The Ukraine\". \n\nAlso on Reuters: \"Pictures of destroyed T80 tanks unique to the Russian army in The Ukraine\".  \n\nNow, for me this is OK. Information on exports of Russian Tanks is readily available and therefore it's a proven fact. I can also live with the usage of the word \"alleged\" because Russia denies it's meddling there.\n\nThey however considered the usage of the word \"alleged\" cowardice and blamed Reuters for hedging their bets. Their point was that since the tanks were found there it was a proven fact that Putin was in there. So they have a point too!\n\nIt's not that simple. News outlets do their best to be unbiased but it doesn't always work and there is no sure fire way of doing it.", "created_utc": 1586095656.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmhw8vm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmht0sj", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmhw8vm", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmhw8vm/"}
