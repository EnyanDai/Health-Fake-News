{"author": {}, "body": "Well the conspiracy is being misconstrued by the media and the shills on purpose. They want you to believe that everyone thinks 5G is CAUSING the virus, which is impossible. OBVIOUSLY. \n\nWhat they don't want you to know is that there have been literally ZERO studies about 5G INHIBITING the virus and making it more deadly than it already is. Which, no one can know for sure this early. I'm not sure I believe it, but I do think it is possible that 5G could weaken and confuse our body's natural responses to a virus, thus making a fairly normal virus, super-contagious and more deadly. No one will know FOR SURE until tests have been done.\n\nWho knows, though. The world is so full of misinformation that we can never really be certain of what's happening, even within our own bodies.
