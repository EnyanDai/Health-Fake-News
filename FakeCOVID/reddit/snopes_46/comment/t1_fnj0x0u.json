Population tracking would be moved on a significant step.\n\nLinking digital ID to your mobile, which has location tracking and other surveillance services activated as part of a pandemic response, would create a panopticon-type access to Data about individuals.\n\nFrom there it\u2019s not far to see a total control system with very little space for privacy and personal liberty.\n\nSome level of paranoia in these times wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea.", "created_utc": 1586989890.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnj0x0u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1u6wr", "parent_id": "t1_fni8qw6", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586990427.0, "name": "t1_fnj0x0u", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/g1u6wr/vandals_set_50_cellphone_masts_in_the_uk_on_fire/fnj0x0u/"}
