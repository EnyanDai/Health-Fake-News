That's not uncommon.\n\nBut I think most of us, after conquering our denial, went and *looked it the fuck up, if for no other reason than to have proof of how right we were.* Or at least, that's how I usually end up being proven wrong. I look it up, and end up swallowing the bitter pill that I'm not right.\n\nAnd that's over something simple. I can't imagine being so attached to a brand new idea that I have exactly *zero* investment in that I would start burning down property over it.\n\nThese people are *fucking dumb*. It's not a matter of manipulation. It's the same shit as anti-vaxxers or the genuine flat-earthers. They're dumb as the dirt they scoot around in. Manipulation happens every day to everyone, but not everyone commits to making their stupid fucking opinions public record without doing *one google search in good faith*.", "created_utc": 1587220476.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsfgcg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fns43a0", "score": 43, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnsfgcg", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnsfgcg/"}
