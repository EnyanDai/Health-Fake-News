Give people free speech and it's inevitable some will use their free speech to talk a load of bollocks. You combat that through education and encouraging critical thinking, which there is a real lack of right now. Don't trust a headline without reading more about it, don't just believe something that's appeared on your facebook feed. Take some time to think about the subject and decide how you feel. For example even though we're being instructed to social distance most of us can actually understand the reason why. If a virus spreads via respiratory droplets, maintaining a distance from other people helps cut down transmission. We've applied critical thinking to what we've been told. Whereas I know someone who is doing it purely because he was  told to, and hadn't even though about the reason. It's that kind of thing, where you just put complete trust in other people to tell you what to think or do, that needs tackled.", "created_utc": 1586146025.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmk6t4i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvfuio", "parent_id": "t1_fminh20", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmk6t4i", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/fvfuio/government_calls_on_tech_companies_to_tackle/fmk6t4i/"}
