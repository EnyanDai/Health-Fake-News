Yes. Long term exposure of sun is bad for your cellular health. Do you want to sit in the sun for 8 hours every day? Does that sound healthy for you? The same will go for this non-ionizing radiation.\n\nThe studies I posted still stand. It's genotoxic, bad for your cells, your chromosomes, your metabolism. If we begin to receive this radiation at all times at home and work because the tower is only 100 ft from us, do you really think there will be 0 effects? And not to mention my claim still stands that all the research done on health effects has been tested with Low energy  tests, including ones for the penetration of the skin. If you want to refute me, post a study contradicted this please.", "created_utc": 1586966644.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnhplsy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngaxj4", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnhplsy", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnhplsy/"}
