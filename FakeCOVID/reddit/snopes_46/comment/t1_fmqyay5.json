The Hemoglobin has an Iron Ion in it which what the Oxygen attaches to when we breathe.\n\n**5G** when transmitted at a 60Ghz frequency actually effects the electrons of Oxygen atoms actually getting them to spin in the opposite direction and effecting the charge.  This can break O2(what we breathe) and O3(Ozone) in singular Oxygen.  This makes it so the blood's hemoglobin can't find any Oxygen that it can actually attach to the Iron and you become Oxygen deprived.  This effect only takes place at around 60Ghz, 58Ghz or 62Ghz shouldn't have much effect on it.\n\nWhat **Coronavirus** does is it attacks the Hemoglobin in the blood stream in the lungs.  It literally pulls the Iron Ion out of the Hemoglobin and then crawls into its spot to live and reproduce.  Because there is no Iron left in the Hemoglobin it can no longer pick up and transport any Oxygen.  Hence you become Oxygen deprived.  The shiny glassing that is taking place in people lungs with Coronavirus is that they are literally getting Iron and other chemical deposits within the lungs as the body is both trying to desperately get the Oxygen needed to fuel the cleaning up of the Iron waste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is why people are coming to that conclusion.  Sadly this also adds to their 5G fears and because they both basically do the same thing in different ways, when used together they become the ultimate weapon of mass destruction on a populace.", "created_utc": 1586309700.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmqyay5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmqyay5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmqyay5/"}
