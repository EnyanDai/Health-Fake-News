There are regulations. They (youtube, facebook and such) are arguing that they are not responsible for illegal content on their site using law about phone companies who are not responsible for the content of the conversations. Phone company legally cannot be a censor in this case.\n\nBut on other hand they do moderate the content, acting as a publisher, which is responsible for the content.\n\nBasically they have best of the both worlds. Those laws are specifically created to rule over activity like this.\n\nOnly reason they use both for their benefit is money. No one wants to go against such large entities. Especially because they play on ruling class side anyway.\n\nYou can be as private company as you like, but there is a billion and a half laws strictly regulating private companies. Ice cream manufacturer cannot suddenly add asbestos in the product just because it is a private company and no one forced to eat it.\n\nThis situation stands on corruption and is unacceptable.", "created_utc": 1586175165.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fml0h7v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmjwyc0", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fml0h7v", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fml0h7v/"}
