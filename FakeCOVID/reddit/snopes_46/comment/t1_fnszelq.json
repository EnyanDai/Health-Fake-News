You've been told that the argument is 'duuuumb people believe 5G created a virus'. That's not the case.\n\nThe argument, however, still false (I've looked into it), is more sophisticated. They believe that COVID-19 is essentially a misdiagnosis and a catch-all term for a number of illnesses. ONE of which, being caused by 5G and the associated mainstream media induced fear/hysteria in a sort of negative feedback loop. Our time's moral panic.\n\nThe problem is we can't all be experts at everything. And there are a TON of beliefs that you hold, given to you by authorities in their field, that you haven't personally verified to be true, I'm sure. The source of this idea is a doctor who presents medical data misleadingly.\n\nThe people who buy into it are smart enough to want to search for the truth, but not well versed enough in medical understanding to know that the hypothesis put forward by this doctor can't be valid.\n\nWe shouldn't mock those looking for answers, but instead help them get the info they are searching for.", "created_utc": 1587231697.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnszelq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fns3nxe", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnszelq", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnszelq/"}
