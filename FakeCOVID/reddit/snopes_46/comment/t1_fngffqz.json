Humans could sense these waves as heat. The use of sub-terahertz (Millimeter wave) communications technology (cellphones, Wi Fi, antennas) could cause humans to percept physical pain via nociceptors.\"\n\n> Computer simulations using the Finite Differences Time Domain (FDTD) method have clearly shown that sweat gland ducts are high absorption structures of mm-waves. SAR values were about one order of magnitude higher with the sweat gland ducts and highly localized to within the sweat gland ducts (Shafirstein and Moros, 2011). Temperatures computed using a bio-heat equation demonstrated that the temperature maximum was moved toward the epidermis which is populated by pain nerve fibers and heat-sensitive keratinocytes. This situation is closer to direct contact with a hot surface, indicating that exposure to high power GHz irradiation should result in a sudden acute pain response even without direct heating of the stratum corneum.\n>\n> This phenomenon may potentially affect all humans and especially susceptible members of the public using or being exposed to communications devices in the sub-terahertz waveband.\n\nHence the call for further research. But why are you against further research? Would you rather be safe or sorry? Also, is there a reason you have such a hard-on for 5G? Can't your hard-on wait until we've conducted further studies around its biological effects?\n\nAlso, what safety health studies have you seen on 5G frequencies in relation to huma eye health?", "created_utc": 1586930564.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngffqz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngf0y5", "score": -13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngffqz", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngffqz/"}
