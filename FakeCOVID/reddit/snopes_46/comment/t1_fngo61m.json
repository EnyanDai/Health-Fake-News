They say it's the cornerstone of democracy. I do agree with that, but I feel the point has been completely lost.\n\nInstead of saying, \"Let's all have a healthy, informed debate about a topic and give more time to the arguments that are factually backed up and easily verifiable\", we are saying, \"Every single opinion, regardless of validity, logic, coherence, or factual backing, should be given an equal amount of time, even if their platform is just screaming the same three sentences over and over\".\n\nOf course, a cadre of less-than-moral individuals have taken huge advantage of that by cutting education and playing on people's preexisting biases in order to line their own pockets while preaching fairness and traditional values. It's just sad. There have even been a number of absurdist movements and counter-religions formed to demonstrate the ridiculousness of this, but it only seems to fan the flames.\n\nI'm so very glad I'm nowhere near the smartest person involved in this debate, in fact, I take great relief in the fact that I'm probably in the lowest tier, because I can't think of a single way our society can get out of this quagmire, and I can only hope that much more intelligent people can figure it out.", "created_utc": 1586938787.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngo61m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngc0t1", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngo61m", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngo61m/"}
