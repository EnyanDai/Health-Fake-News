Remember all those idiots you went to school with that couldn't understand even the most basic things being taught? Well they all grew up and stayed exactly that stupid. They got smart phones and social media accounts and even though that put the entire wealth of recorded human knowledge at their finger tips, that didn't make them smart enough to understand it. So when smarter people are talking, they aren't hearing what's being said. When something comes along that seems to make sense to them or gives them an outlet or reason for why things are fucked up in the world, they latch on to it. Boom, thanks to the internet, they find a whole community of people just as stupid as them and they feel accepted. What they don't realize is the whole story was most likely made up by someone much smarter than them just trolling the net for idiots that they can manipulate and abuse for profit.\n\nEdit, wasn't expecting this to blow up. I apologize for sounding cranky about it, but I've been dealing with a lot of people that I thought were smart enough to not get sucked into this kind of crap. Also I fixed that crazy run on sentence. It was just a little rant so I didn't put a lot of effort into grammar or editing.
