After my mom gave me a bath she put my brother on the tub to take a bath too. Her friend called her and she stayed talking on the phone with her back turned to the tub. When I went to look my 1 year old brother was face down in the tub and even though I was only 2 I knew instinctual that something was wrong. I tried to get her attention but she told me to shut up or she'll give me powpow (hit me). She eventually turned around and found my brother lifeless in the tub. Instead of calling an ambulance (probably because cps would take us) she called my dad. He rushed over and successfully resusitated him. He is 25 and has never went to college or have a job I wonder if it's because of that incident and if he got brain damage.", "created_utc": 1586906174.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnfdu0r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g11x0r", "parent_id": "t3_g11x0r", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_5r98w", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnfdu0r", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/FuckYouKaren/comments/g11x0r/when_somebody_says_5g_doesnt_cause_coronavirus/fnfdu0r/"}
