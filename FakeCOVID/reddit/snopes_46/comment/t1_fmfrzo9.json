If a shallow 'barbarism' is your qualifier, then presumably the post diocletian roman empire is equally barbaric. The breakdown in centralisation and taxation happened long before the fall of rome, and the church often took the place, in terms of temporal gravitas and cente of art and learning, of declining imperial authority.\n\nI am fully aware that many classics were translated through arabic, and that Europe was a relative backwater in comparison to areas like baghdad, but you're pitting forward a very memetic 'the chart' esque version of history that doesn't really hold water. \n\nAlso, areas fell into barbarism following the fall of the ottoman empire in 1923? News to me.\n\nAlso in terms of rome, byzantium endured. And given that various high ranking germanic novles wound up in the varangian guard, and there was byzantine transmission to england, then you're missing a lot.", "created_utc": 1586033619.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmfrzo9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_furdeu", "parent_id": "t1_fmfegai", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586034155.0, "name": "t1_fmfrzo9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/furdeu/masts_set_on_fire_over_false_5g_coronavirus_claims/fmfrzo9/"}
