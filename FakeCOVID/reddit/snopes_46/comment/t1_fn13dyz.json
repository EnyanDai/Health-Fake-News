I am saying that doesn't mean every chinese tourist take shits in streets or that it is common for the tourists to do so.\n\n>Who the fuck gives a shit about what you\u2019ve seen? What does that matter?\n\nBecause something that happens so little with a population so large means it isn't some consistency/relevant statistic. If it was relevant then I would see it living in a big city. But it's not. Most people don't make a splash. When someone does something stupid it makes news/spreads through social media.\n\nThe chinese tourists who do not shit in the street do not get stories written about them, but those people do not fit into your model of who those people are.
