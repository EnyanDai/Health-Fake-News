I also work on non energy requirements which this topic and other toxicity issues have historically fallen under.\n\nIn this role I've sat in meetings with FCC engineers and lawyers discussing these very issues, as it is literally *their* job to deal with RF signal and any impact on public health and regulate it... \n\nMy most relevant direct experience is personally leading the push to have any EU proposed criteria regarding \"wireless smog\" in a currently in development international environmental standard on networking equipment through the GEC squashed on technical grounds. The standard dev voting members (myself included) dropped all consideration because the EU couldn't provide a shred of actual legitimate technical justification for the criteria. \n\nOne could argue I'm more qualified to speak on this than just about anyone, as I literally influence US policy on it in my job, whereas you are stringing together a bunch of online articles from scientists who don't work on government policy for this who don't seem to  understand basic RF (medical doctors...).\n\nYou still have not answered the most basic question I've asked you. If millimeter waves do not contain enough energy to penetrate below the top layers of your skin, which not only RF engineers know, but is experimentally confirmed by the NIH, how is it physically possible for them to alter the chemistry of cells well below those layers (which are mostly dead skin by the way) in any meaningful way? If you can't concisely move past that basic logic test, anything else you link is irrelevant and frankly I'm not familiar enough with their experimental controls to know if even accurate at that point.", "created_utc": 1587042592.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnkxpnc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnkg69e", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnkxpnc", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnkxpnc/"}
