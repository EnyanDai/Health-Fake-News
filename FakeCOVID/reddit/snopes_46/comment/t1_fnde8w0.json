I'm a plumber. and no I understand that fully but I just doubt they are putting them up with 12 gauge wire or something lol and some of the videos floating around that show a design of 5g transmitter that mounts to wooden poles and not a standalone pole with transmitter/light, they are using a pretty thick line to connect them to the power grid and if they built the devices to handle much more than what safe levels recommend the power be at-it would be nice to know-and would explain why they are using line around the size of power line to power the transmitters . especially since the majority of them will be coupled with a light on a pole, which admittedly we would never know the gauge wire they used unless someone took off the access panel cover at the bottom of the pole to look. even 0 gauge wire can take almost 3000 watts at 300+ amps-pair that with the right capacitors inside the 5g device and then stack that on all the other 5g devices working in close proximity and I would think you could have a problem in the long run. and as far as I know or have seen, they aren't allowing independent studies on the devices or the effects of them which should raise a few eyebrows imo.", "created_utc": 1586867804.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnde8w0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g0rx6e", "parent_id": "t1_fndadbt", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586868784.0, "name": "t1_fnde8w0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/g0rx6e/5g_tower_fire_in_italy_during_coronavirus_lockdown/fnde8w0/"}
