Its reach is also less, so you either need to keep it localised, or keep installing hordes of expensive signal repeaters that are all costly to run.\n\nThis means that public usage will most likely be limited to a lower-but-still-higher-than-4G frequency band as compromise, and the Big Boy version will likely be limited to campus nets.\n\n\\---\n\nAlso, I regret to admit that I fully support one of the main populists of the Netherlands (Thierry Baudet) with his summary and proposal, I think it applies to all Western nations:\n\nWe either go the affordable route and band up with China, or we go the unaffordable route and keep it within Europe and the USA. The latter would also mean that we can't use it how we want because that'd be too expensive.\n\nBecause **there's no urgency** to implementy 5G, they propose to continue optimising the 4G network while investing in, well, Western technology (he's a populist) for 5G in a number of years.\n\nIt'll give us the time to conduct further research into potential health risks, as well as minimise any spy shenanigans!", "created_utc": 1586916342.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnfvhmz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnff9br", "score": 91, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnfvhmz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnfvhmz/"}
