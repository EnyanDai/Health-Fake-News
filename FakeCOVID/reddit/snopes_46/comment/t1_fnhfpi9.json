To me, the only crossover between them is \"i dont like what they think\"\n\nYou act like science denial is shared by both Nazi's and flat earthers, when nazi's were OBSESSED with science. Nazi's literally formed NASA (you know that organization that tells us all about space)\n\nSo as well as it was written, i see the point you are TRYING to make, but seriously comparing apples with cake. Only commonality is that they are food. Kind of silly to compare everything you dont like to Nazi's. Thats why Trump won. But hey, its reddit.
