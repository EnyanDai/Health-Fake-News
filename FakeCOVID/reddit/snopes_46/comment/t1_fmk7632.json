I was just saying that 5G may not be a \"bad\" thing, but the research behind why we're advancing in microwave-based technology may be, and we have to expect governments to be doing research in every possible way to detect and destroy enemies. I'm not trying to drop a bombshell comment or anything. I just think maybe the conspiracy theorists are going in the wrong direction with the theory that COVID was caused by 5G or whatever they say. Sure, mutations happen because of heat, and microwaves can cause heat through chemical manipulation, but it doesn't mean 5G is the culprit, or 5G developers are culpable. But, the day that microwave signals can be precisely aimed at territories across the globe remotely, the outcomes of a fight using those weapons is something I would not care to live to see. This is all assuming that these weapons aren't already developed. They already have a cannon that beams microwaves to split up and separate crowds of people from a short distance away, and that was developed in 2010. How far could they have come in 10 years with all the technological advancements going on? Again, not a bombshell- just find it curious.", "created_utc": 1586146292.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmk7632", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmk5kxx", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmk7632", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmk7632/"}
