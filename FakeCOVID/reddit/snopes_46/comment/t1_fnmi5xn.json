Other examples of EM radiation are microwaves (yes, the microwaves use those) and gamma waves, to name a few. More specifically, 5G uses a part of the electromagnetic spectrum known as radio frequencies. Radio waves belong to the non-ionising part of the EM spectrum, meaning they don\u2019t really \u201cinteract\u201d with the body (they don\u2019t ionise atoms). This means it\u2019s completely harmless in theory, the theory being our current understanding of electromagnetic field mechanics. If you prove this theory wrong, you can book a flight to Stockholm to collect your Nobel prize. \n\nHowever, this is in theory, and theory isn\u2019t practice. In practice things could go wrong or be slightly different depending on many things like temperatures or god knows what. Although I would (and have in the past) trust this theory with my life, the regular precautions probably apply here: \n\nAre 5G antennas dangerous? No. Should you press your face against one for three hours? No probably not. This applies to many things though. It\u2019s not a good idea to stand right next to a running microwave (especially an older model) for hours, but we aren\u2019t worried about those. \n\nIf you\u2019re still on the fence, I suggest doing the calculations for yourself. They\u2019re not hard at all as it\u2019s pretty basic physics.", "created_utc": 1587071860.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnmi5xn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnlptmn", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 1, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnmi5xn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnmi5xn/"}
