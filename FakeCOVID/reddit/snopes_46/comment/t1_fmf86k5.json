Russia Today putting out anti 5G pieces whilst Russia it's self rushes to build out 5G infrastructure. Maybe businesses who sell specialised SATCOM stuff and don't want that business to be taken up by a cheap consumer grade solution?\n\nSecond is the real bulk. It's 2020 and you can make money on the web by saying stupid shit. Got a YouTube channel? Talk about 5G to bring in the clicks  and cries and money. Got a web store selling healing oils or radiation blocking pillows?  Then this is your chance to make some \u00a5\u00a5\u00a5\n\nThird prong is the bit that spreads it all. People were anxious about the world before COVID and now it's worse, but they can't solve it. They aren't microbiologists, or economists, or public health experts. Their small level problems are normally solved by talking about things. Relationship problems, money problems, etc.\n\nBut now there's a way to take a global pandemic and make it a problem that can be fixed. You can talk to friends and family about 5G. You can share a petition to stop 5G. Or perhaps you can go and set fire to a base station. You're doing your bit!", "created_utc": 1586021874.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmf86k5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fusbll", "parent_id": "t1_fmf22fw", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmf86k5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fusbll/no_5g_is_not_causing_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmf86k5/"}
