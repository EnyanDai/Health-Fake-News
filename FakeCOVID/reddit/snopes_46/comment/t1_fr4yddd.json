Naturally, it's not practical to survey the entire country. In short, theoretically, there's 95% certainty the reported numbers are within 3% of what the actual numbers of the population would be\n\nHonestly, when you get down to it, I think the number of people you can definitely assume are thinking Bill Gates or 5G are actually responsible is a decent bit smaller than what the headline implies (shocker, I know). Personally, I wouldn't be too surprised if 2-5 out of 100 people believe that. It's still depressing but certainly more acceptable than 12.5. On the other hand, it's also important to not ignore the fact that there are a decent amount of people saying 'Probably Yes' instead of 'Probably No'. Biases and errors come into play and you can pick apart the number, but it is alarming that these theories have caught so much steam.", "created_utc": 1589899200.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr4yddd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t3_gmhezr", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr4yddd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr4yddd/"}
