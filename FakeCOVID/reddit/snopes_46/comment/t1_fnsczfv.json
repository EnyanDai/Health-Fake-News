In some cases, Huawei used 10-year-old versions of libraries containing dozens of vulnerabilities rather than selecting newer, more secure options.\n\nThe report goes into significantly more detail, but the above should give everyone the gist of just how bad their security truly is.", "created_utc": 1587218897.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsczfv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3g35m", "parent_id": "t1_fnrid5y", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnsczfv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China/comments/g3g35m/uk_moves_to_drop_huawei_as_5g_vendor_citing_china/fnsczfv/"}
