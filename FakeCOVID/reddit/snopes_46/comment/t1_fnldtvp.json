Do you have any backing, or is it just I read a post where someone said dead grass. If that\u2019s your theory, what is causing the dead grass?  \n  \nBased on your reply and all the downvotes I'm getting I think you and many others misunderstand the sentiment I was trying to get across.   \n  \nI personally don't believe they are a danger, and I certainly do not condone the actions of people destroying them. I'm merely pointing out the fact that we are basically going all judge, jury and executioner on these people for being ignorant of them possibly being safe. While we are being equally ignorant of them possibly not being safe.   \n  \nWhen it comes to long term exposure of 5G. Neither the people destroying them, or us, have any real clue.   \n  \nIf anything my post was a reaction to the witch hunt rhetoric of the guy I was replying. As for me personally my standpoint is \"we do not know\", but people in this entire post is acting as if they're experts on the field.", "created_utc": 1587051802.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnldtvp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnl88cz", "score": -7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnldtvp", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnldtvp/"}
