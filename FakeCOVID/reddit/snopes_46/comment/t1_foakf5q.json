The US has a tradition of rugged individualism and not all of it is due to Ronald Reagan as my comment might imply. I just wanted to highlight that even within the American tradition there was a time where social and class consciousness was a big thing.\n\nI think the Cold War probably destroyed a lot of that, and then Reagan gave it a neoliberal death blow. That's why Bernie Sanders' campaign was so interesting to me, it was the rebirth of FDR's politics. Bernie is no socialist (maybe in the French centre-left definition of the term) and had he called himself an \"FDR Democrat\" instead I think he would have had a bigger chance of winning. The whole discussion about him being a socialist was completely worthless and damaging to the cause.", "created_utc": 1587648140.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "foakf5q", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rr17", "parent_id": "t1_fo8cs7i", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_foakf5q", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/g5rr17/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/foakf5q/"}
