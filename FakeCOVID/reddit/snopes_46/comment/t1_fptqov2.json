Some person writes some bullshit, either seriously, ironically, as a shower thought, a brain fart, an interested manipulation, or whatever.\n2.

It gets shared exponentially, to millions of people.\n4. A tiny percentage of those millions, are retarded or deranged enough to believe it's the absolute truth. \n5. Now you have a tiny group of maybe a dozen wackos *actively* trying to convince everyone of their \"truth\", and maybe taking matters into their own hands. \n\nBy the sole nature of the information spread, this creates what is essentially guerilla warfare, with separate tiny cells acting mostly independently from each other, which is the hardest to counteract.\n\nAdd the fact that there is a *huge* portion of the population who don't understand basic science, and they'll swallow any bullshit, hook and sinker.", "created_utc": 1588896335.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptqov2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt9des", "score": 34, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1588896685.0, "name": "t1_fptqov2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptqov2/"}
