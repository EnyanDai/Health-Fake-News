What's your proof, Mr. Burder of Proof?!\n\nI can tell you have difficulty with reading comprehension. I said the technology has been proven to not cause local heating effects, which is understood by the scientific community as the primary concern when considering the effects 5G has on humans.\n\nOkay, since you requested it. [this](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S1759078711000122) study by Cambridge Radiophysist Maxim Zhadobov along with the help of Chahat, an electrical engineer, Quement, a Ph.D. in biology, Sauleau with a Ph.D. in biological studies, and Drean, a Ph.D. in molecular biology and biochemistry. You can read the study for yourself, but in a nutshell they found that the only significant result of exposure to MMW was a slight heating, significantly below environmental thermal fluctuations. They also found that MMW actually had a positive effect on cellular proliferation of cancer cells. It went on to also acknowledge that MMW has no effect on genetic expression, and that it is not genotoxic. It seems you have fallen for the trap of the Dunning-Kruger effect and have eaten up what the internet told you.", "created_utc": 1586977851.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnicuzc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnhyx4y", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnicuzc", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnicuzc/"}
