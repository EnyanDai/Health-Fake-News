I'm situated on a somewhat less residential road... 1.65 acres, and the properties around me are all fenced in so the only way they can get access to it is via my driveway. \n\nI've been self quarantined as I want to keep my distance, so I was pretty annoyed. It seemed odd that we are supposed to be home and non essential businesses should be closed. First guys came out said it was for Google fiber, second guy said it was for Spectrum. I already have fiber so it seemed a bit strange. I was thinking, how is this utility cable work \"essential\" and why the hell are they going on my property and down my driveway. Now after reading how 5g is trying to be rolled quickly.... I'm sure that's what they are planning to install.", "created_utc": 1585948056.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmclniu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuczaj", "parent_id": "t3_fuczaj", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmclniu", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fuczaj/robert_f_kennedy_jr_posted_this_regarding_5g_and/fmclniu/"}
