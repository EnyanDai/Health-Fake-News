It only requires that you not be a moron.\n\nIf you believe that these claims are \"probably true\" without having seen evidence or having even thought about the issue for the slightest moment, then you are already a moron for coming to a conclusion so prematurely. \n\nIf you believe that these claims are \"probably true\" and *have* thought it through, then you are even more of a moron for having failed to reach the obvious conclusion.\n\nThat is before mentioning that the thought required to reach the correct conclusion that these theories are total bollocks amounts to perhaps an entire quarter of a second. The 5G conspiracy, for example, can be dismissed for a whole host of reasons, some of which include things that we can reasonably expect anyone who is not a moron to know.
