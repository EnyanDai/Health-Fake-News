Our brains are electromagnetic.  \n\nNo, they are not. There is an electrical component to the nervous system, but our bodies are not computers, they are wet goop, to use a formal scientific term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>5G is an unprecedented change to these fields on our bodies with an exponential increase in exposure.  \n\nNo, it isn't. You're lying. 5G covers existing spectrum, as well as some nearby spectrum that acts the same as existing spectrum. To the extent that anything is new, it is a higher frequency, and therefore will expose people to less energy as it is more easily absorbed by walls, clothing, rain, or even air (we don't live in a vacuum, the air is full of physical matter).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, everyone who slept through Algebra 2 / Calculus and Physics is getting worked up, while everyone who understands that logarithmic scales apply to frequencies, signal strength, etc. is over here yawning at potential implications of 5G.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, I do have good news. Tin foil hats do actually help block radio emissions. I've seen estimates of -40 dB, which means that it blocks 99.9999% (log scale, remember?) of all wi-fi energy from interfering with your brain.", "created_utc": 1587231807.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnszly9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnspa60", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnszly9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnszly9/"}
