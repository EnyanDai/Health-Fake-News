I don't think anyone is suggesting that a society which rejects fascism and white supremacy with any degree of intellectual rigor must condemn a person over a single random accusation levied via internet argument.    \n  \nThat's the frustrating implication of your comment.  This global far-right movement is absolutely hiding behind this \"herp derp everyone I disagree with is a fascist\" meme.  But that's not what is actually happening.  People are not just throwing around pejoratives - they are rigorously applying definitions to words and actions and arriving at a somewhat dire conclusion.  I mean, I've spent three decades having good-faith disagreements with conservatives.  This contemporary movement is not the same thing - it is conservatism where the very pretense of truth and good faith have been abandoned in favor of rote authoritarianism - aka neo-fascism.", "created_utc": 1586958239.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnh9ws4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnh1cna", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnh9ws4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnh9ws4/"}
