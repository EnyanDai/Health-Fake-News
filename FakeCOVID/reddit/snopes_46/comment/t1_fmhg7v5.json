They accuse us of \u201cnot looking into it\u201d when in fact we do and are quickly dissuaded by the wave of utter nonsense and complete disregard of basic scientific principles. \n\nI was actually added to a Facebook group full of these idiots who would rave on about how ignorant everybody else was and how they are smart because they see through it all. Every single article or video they shared was some random asshole claiming to be a scientist, medical worker, government official, company boss etc, and none provided credentials or evidence of any kind that they knew what they were talking about.
