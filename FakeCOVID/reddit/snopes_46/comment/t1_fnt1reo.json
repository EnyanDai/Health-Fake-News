They were either considered \"dumb\" if they had a mild disability, or were warehoused in poor quality institutions if they had a moderate or severe disability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even then, the real swap occurred in 1990 with IDEA, which setup modern special education. So, to answer your question, we've only meaningfully attempted to diagnose children with learning disabilities properly for the last 30 years. And of course we've gotten better over time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, the diagnostic criteria has changed somewhat recently, as Asperger's is no longer a separate diagnosis, but part of autism spectrum disorder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's the problem with these arguments. People use \"facts\" that they don't understand to seemingly support their arguments, when they don't. If you don't understand the history of US special education and diagnostic criteria for autism, you cannot correctly understand what the numbers mean.", "created_utc": 1587232956.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnt1reo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnsq9o9", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnt1reo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnt1reo/"}
