Narcissism doesn't seem to know class boundaries; some become the Trumps of the world, some become the Joe Exotics of the world, but most of them are completely powerless and disenfranchised... not born rich, not cunning enough to con their way up the ladder, so they are drawn into these kinds of underdog \"movements\" where they can get together and circle-jerk each other.\n\nThey love the smell of their own shit, they will always see themselves as the smartest person in the room, they will always be the victim.\n\nImagine if these people could see the bigger picture and focus their rage on things that *actually mattered*.  Campaign finance reform?  Climate change?  Their identity becomes so intertwined with iconoclasm, contrarianism, counterculturalism, that if it makes logical sense, it *must be wrong.*", "created_utc": 1586156212.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkim0f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmjtidb", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586156459.0, "name": "t1_fmkim0f", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmkim0f/"}
