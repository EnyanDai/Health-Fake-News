The second one is even mentioned in my caption below. Each country has regulatory bodies. They are independent, unless you believe in some global conspiracy between all nations. As much as it pains me to say this, you should trust your governments assessment on the safety of RF.\n\nFrom, for example Canadas page.\n\n\"2. Maximum Exposure Limits\n\nThe scientific literature with respect to possible biological effects of RF fields has been monitored by Health Canada scientists on an ongoing basis. Since the last version of Safety Code 6 was published (2009), a significant number of new studies have evaluated the potential for acute and chronic RF field exposures to elicit possible effects on a wide range of biological endpoints including: human cancers; rodent lifetime mortality; tumor initiation, promotion and co-promotion; mutagenicity and DNA damage; EEG activity; memory, behaviour and cognitive functions; gene and protein expression; cardiovascular function; immune response; reproductive outcomes; and perceived electromagnetic hypersensitivity among others. Numerous authoritative reviews have summarized the current literature (4-8, 17-40).\n\nDespite the advent of numerous additional research studies on RF fields and health, the only established adverse health effects associated with RF field exposures in the frequency range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz relate to the occurrence of tissue heating and nerve stimulation (NS) from short-term (acute) exposures. At present, there is no scientific basis for the occurrence of acute, chronic and/or cumulative adverse health risks from RF field exposure at levels below the limits outlined in Safety Code 6. The hypotheses of other proposed adverse health effects occurring at levels below the exposure limits outlined in Safety Code 6 suffer from a lack of evidence of causality, biological plausibility and reproducibility and do not provide a credible foundation for making science-based recommendations for limiting human exposures to low-intensity RF fields.\"", "created_utc": 1586662869.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn5en3b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyszf4", "parent_id": "t1_fn40hkw", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn5en3b", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fyszf4/5g_is_not_linked_to_the_coronavirus_pandemic_in/fn5en3b/"}
