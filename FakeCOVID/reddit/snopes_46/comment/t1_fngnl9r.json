Just want more in depth testing. I expected to get down voted an that's fine. I'm looking for the AMA link now so people can see themselves from a professional that it didn't get much safety testing \n\nAlso as far as power.. the 5g towers near me are not small repeaters. They are HUGE towers with white rectangle boxes on top in a 360 around the very top. Also some drum shaped signal things. The amount of wire running from base to top an high voltage signs all around the double gated perimeter just seems eerie.  I added links to above post and adding the AMA now bc it's great information from a few certified professionals. Thanks though. I'm just pointing out the covid19 5g thing is a new conspiracy. Some doctor said cv19 was results or iron molecules not binding to hemoglobin in lungs from the 5G. No evidence to back it though. Most others are concerned of the millimeter waves because lack of testing an being used in military weapons. What if the power was boosted to the tramsmitter? Or the frequency raised. Iirc 5g uses 40-300hz (UHF) BUT IS CAPABLE of much higher. Without much fail safe. That's the concern if that makes sense.", "created_utc": 1586938208.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngnl9r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnglg2b", "score": -15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngnl9r", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngnl9r/"}
