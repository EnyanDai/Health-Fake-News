I think someone with an agenda and a lot of money are lumping some real concerns into fake-hysteria issues so as to discredit the real concerns. I don't know what the real concerns are but they must be important and nefarious - that's the only way I can explain the crazy shit I see...\n\nAs I said I've come full circle and in so doing at least to some extent understand how someone falls into the rabbit hole and starts doubting everything around them. I no longer engage with them because it's tiring. This is a literal quote I saw today from someone getting resistance to their BS claims: \"This is a free world, and you can operate from a lower vibration if you'd like, but keep me out of it. Blessings\"\n\nLovely, otherwise great people. People I respected for their calm and loving ways - now wishing death upon 5G workers, actors, newscasters and other famous people. I look at them and their nonsensical easily verifiable as false claims from blogs and they in turn snort at my willingness to accept anything the mainstream media tries to spoonfeed me. \" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)?
