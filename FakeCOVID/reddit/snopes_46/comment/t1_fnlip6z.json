This isn't totally crazy because the US government suggested that Huawei 5G might be loaded with Chinese spying hardware.  If the Chinese can put barely detectable spying hardware on the 5G, well anyone can.  Right?\n\nNow the wacky version of anti-5G.  4G has a single band and that band has limited use.  And so the more people who use it, the slower it will become, you have to begin limiting bandwidth to maintain quality.  Most of the world's 4G network is tapped which necesitated another way.  5G is built in for overuse.  5G uses three internet bands  Each band covers a smaller area than the previous in which the weakest band is the broadest one and will allow you to go over a wider area.  The fastest band covers a very small amount of area but is super powerful.\n\n5G skeptics are claiming that the highest 5G band weakens your immune system and makes you more susceptible to a virus.  Part of their claim is that Wuhan has 5G and it spreads like wildfire there and they point to other places that have 5G (like New York City) where it is also spreading like wildfire.  The more extreme version of this is that coronavirus is a digital disease that comes from the towers themselves and all the doctors are lying.\n\nAfter this kinds of claims spread to Nigeria and started causing civil unrest the government put out a [statement](https://allafrica.com/stories/202004060134.html) contesting that they have 5G.", "created_utc": 1587054227.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnlip6z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnl1ali", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnlip6z", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnlip6z/"}
