They use it for crowd control in riots bc when directed at people it makes them feel like their skin is on fire. They also use it in Iraq as a means for intimidating the enemy bc when blasted with 5G they start to cower and give up fighting. The 5G they would use for internet only operate at as much as 86GHz, where the militarized form operates at 96GHz. These are the few things I think that make people question whether or not it\u2019s a good thing.
