I cannot believe this happened organically.  Reminds me a lot of Alex Jones/Flat Earth/Anti Vax stuff.  It doesn't come from nowhere.  China/Russia/USA/Corps are very into creating fake movements that help their interest.  What's the best way to get people to dislike something?  Create a fake version of it that sucks.  Want to get people to stop thinking your company's products cause cancer?  Pay to have a conspiracy group claim that your product causes cancer because aliens sent it through the wormhole that connects earth to the Sirus Star system, where interdimensional reptillians live.  People will stop believing your company's product gives you cancer real quick.\n\nI don't know what purpose this \"5g conspiracy\" has, besides to make conspiracy theory/critical thinking seem crazy.  I'd guess it's CIA doing it.  They did similar things after 9/11 with people like Alex Jones, Dr. Judy Wood. \n\nIt's called \"poisoning the well\".\n\nSaying the Saudis took part in 9/11 doesn't sound that crazy.  Then the CIA has plants who add in \"Alien Starbeams blew up the world trade center\", and the whole 9/11 movement got derailed, and mocked.", "created_utc": 1587211953.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fns40yt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fns3nxe", "score": 62, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587212063.0, "name": "t1_fns40yt", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fns40yt/"}
