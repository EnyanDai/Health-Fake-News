I think the root of this comes down to most people have no idea about how our technology works, and a genuine distrust of people in power (which has been earned over decades), with lying politicians, greedy corporations, and 'experts' that make things up . Ask most people what the difference between 4G and 5G is, many have no idea. This lack of knowledge, combined with a lack of trust in 'leaders' and fear caused by a unknown such as Covid-19 (something most people can only take the word of other is caused by a virus), it becomes a perfect combo to push people over to the conspiracy groups. I think there would still be a few towers damaged or engineers attacked, as there have always been those on the fringes willing to do this, but I think most of this is driven by fear.", "created_utc": 1587061106.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnlwt7b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnlp746", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnlwt7b", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnlwt7b/"}
