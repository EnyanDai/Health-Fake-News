That creature (the octopus, not the yank) was so intelligent. Heartbreaking that they have such short lifespans. Also upsetting that, from that evidence, they're clearly extremely intelligent and that octopus must have been quite bored being in that tank. However maybe we can hope that if more is known about octopus intelligence the better they will get treated when in captivity (and maybe not eaten as much in restaurants).\n\nAs for if they do suddenly start living longer, it's encouraging that they show signs of feelings and even liking some humans. They might keep us as pets rather than just wipe us out.", "created_utc": 1586037525.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmfyj5e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_furdeu", "parent_id": "t1_fmfa6h4", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmfyj5e", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/furdeu/masts_set_on_fire_over_false_5g_coronavirus_claims/fmfyj5e/"}
