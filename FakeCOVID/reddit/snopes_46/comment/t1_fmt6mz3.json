Power levels are way more important than frequency when it comes to non-ionizing radiation. That's why there's power limits for all RF, including cell towers. Lots of people (including people in this thread) are saying the 5G is more dangerous than 4G because of its higher frequency, that's why I put that part in.\n\nSunlight is a little different because it contains both ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, but sunlight has a power level of [1000 W/m\\^2](https://ag.tennessee.edu/solar/Pages/What%20Is%20Solar%20Energy/Sun's%20Energy.aspx). Infared radiation from ovens and stove tops are also in the 1000's of W. Most microwaves are 1000W or greater (inside the microwave, obviously). That's why those sources can burn you.\n\nBut if you wanna think about constant exposure, what about the [Outgoing longwave radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgoing_longwave_radiation) that the earth is constantly giving off? We can even calculate how much energy that is and compare it to 5G:\n\nIf we say that the average temperature of the earth is around 13 degrees C (287K) and that is behaves as a black body (in reality it doesn't behave as a perfect black body, but its pretty close), then the energy emitted by the earth is found by Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n\nE = (Stefan-Boltzmann\u2019s constant)\\*(Temp of earth)\\^(4)\n\nE = (5.67\\*10\\^(-8) Wm\\^-2K-4)\\*(287k)\\^4 = 384 W/m\\^2\n\nSo we are all being exposed to somewhere in the neighborhood of 300-400W/m\\^2 of  3.0-74.9THz radiation at all times. I can guarantee there's no 5G towers giving off anywhere near 300W/m\\^2 of any radiation\n\n[this source](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/human-exposure-radio-frequency-fields-guidelines-cellular-and-pcs-sites) says that cell towers give off an \"actual radiated power of 5-10 watts\"", "created_utc": 1586367708.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmt6mz3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t1_fmt0nbp", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586367994.0, "name": "t1_fmt6mz3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmt6mz3/"}
