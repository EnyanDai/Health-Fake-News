Yes I feel perfectly happy defending the view that that edited image of Corbyn is not deceptive\n\n>I ask the question because, unless you are prepared to do so, it might be construed that you support [this](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/mike-sivier-libel-fight/) kind of aggressive litigation to prevent someone from \"making their own point\". I am not saying that you are wrong but asking if you extend that same assumption to other people. Say, critics of Rachel Riley?\n\nLook mate I'm not interested in taking a side in some big [battle](https://pbfcomics.com/comics/skub/) for or against against Rachel Riley, I'm saying that the image she posted is very clearly an edit and not deceptive.\n\n>It is very fake news as the original image was used in evidence to prosecute Corbyn for protesting against Apartheid. Riley's adaptation of the image does not acknowledge that it is an adaptation which, arguably, puts it into the category of libellous publication.\n\nThis is insane.
