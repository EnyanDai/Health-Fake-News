My god is Thor\" in a desire for camaraderie, the Christian theists hears \"I have been deceived by a spirit into worshiping a false god\". \n\nWhich is an abomination. Remember what God did to His own chosen people when they worshiped the golden calf? The story it is so brutal that even people who never read the Bible and atheist know about the story. \n\nIt literally became a multicultural meme that lasted hundreds of years. \n\nIf He feels that way about His _own chosen people_ worshiping false gods, what would His reaction be to non-believers?\n\nIt seems absolutely objectively egalitarian to say \"Worship of all gods is equally acceptable\", and probably is the furthest end of accomodation that the most empathic atheists will ever go. \n\nExcept to the Christian ear it sounds like: \"Your god is equal to deceiving spirits, you have to honor their choice to be deceived\".\n\nThis is especially tough because Christians are mandated to proselytize to the unbeliever, and when we do we are told _we_ are being unreasonable \"because they already have their own gods\". \n\nWhich we hear as \"You are not permitted to save them from their deception, because if we are to respect the fact that you are religious, you need to respect the fact that they are differently religious\". \n\nWhich again, to non-Christian ears sounds perfectly reasonable, egalitarian and fair.   \n\nBut to Christian ears it again sounds just like the above \"Your god is equal to deceiving spirits\".", "created_utc": 1588895109.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptogrt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptiipp", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptogrt", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptogrt/"}
