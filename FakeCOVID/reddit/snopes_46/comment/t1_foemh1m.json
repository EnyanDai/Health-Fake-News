Which is dumb, because no that won't happen.\n\nWhen they say that bs I wrote there, they will usually start claiming that 5G is dangerous, because some electromagnetic radiation burns. But they never seem to realize, that the people who actually have gotten burnt by electromagnetic fields are working near immensely more powerful antennas (somewhere probably around the 100kW - 1000kW) which are known to cause burns, but only if you're right next to them.\n\nThose folks are ridiculous, trying to keep everyone at a slower internet speeds because they can't read for shit about a thing they criticize.\n\nFor me personally, 5G would right now be a godsend in terms of internet speeds, as I can't get fiber here, because there is a monopoly on it, so it costs way too fucking much, and 4G can only do so much before it gets clogged and slow.\n\nLastly, [5G causes Coronavirus: BUSTED!!!\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVJgKeKwEc8&) a good video, highly suggest watching.\n\nWhoops this became a rant, sorry, but I just hate people who get mad and destroy things they don't understand anything about.", "created_utc": 1587707808.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "foemh1m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g6vp2j", "parent_id": "t1_foe3naf", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi1r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_foemh1m", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/meme/comments/g6vp2j/if_you_think_5g_towers_caused_coronavirus_your/foemh1m/"}
