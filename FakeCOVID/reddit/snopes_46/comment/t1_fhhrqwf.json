I don't consider ANY Android worth more than 300$, **for the simplest reason that it's generally only supported for a year or less.** Also the hardware packed into it is not that great imo, it's about as fast as a iphone 7/8, nothing special. Camera's more pixels =/= better image quality if only it worked that way lol.\n\nIf you like it -- great, downvote all you want, but I'm just saying as long as Android is subpar on basic areas and lacking basic features I don't consider it premium devices, regardless of brand, or of what they have inside them. -- though if they were like actually fast and snappy I might consider it, but at this rate it will take Samsung 2 more years to beat the iPhone 8 lmfao. Basic stuff Android as a platform needs to fix for me to consider them a Premium umbrella brand:\n\n\\- years of solid updates, not just security updates.  \n\\- a basic integrated internet messenger, like iMessage.  \n\\- A closed store that is better moderated against malware.  \n\\- Ditching Java and other ancient language so you can actually develop something for the god damn platform without giving headache. Also nobody buys anything on Android so personally I would not bother bringing my apps there.\n\nIf you like Samsung or Android, great these are just MY PERSONAL reasons why I don't consider them competition for the iPhone. Actually I don't consider Android at all. It's a complete no brainer to me, each to their own.", "created_utc": 1581610445.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fhhrqwf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_f38jqa", "parent_id": "t1_fhhnds5", "score": -37, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1f", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1581611458.0, "name": "t1_fhhrqwf", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/f38jqa/digitimes_coronavirus_production_delays_will_not/fhhrqwf/"}
