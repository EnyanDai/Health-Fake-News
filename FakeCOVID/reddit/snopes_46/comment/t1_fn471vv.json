We\u2019ve been duped into trauma based mind control, by psychopaths. We don\u2019t recognize that, when traumatized and without the awareness of said trauma, the mind creates a fictional character within consciousness, which is the mind\u2019s literal narrative (we think thoughts for an illusion because we believe we ARE the illusion itself), but which doesn\u2019t exist in actual, objective, selfless reality. The world seems so chaotic and fast paced because it is a manifestation of the chaotic, broken, collective human mind. \n\nWe go around believing in things, when we do not even truly know them to be true. Our beliefs then manifest, through our subconscious, as external reality. So, ultimately, our subconscious is being manipulated by wicked external forces, which they only have the power to do if they are able to traumatize humanity. Trauma takes us away from the present and ties us into time. Why? Because any time something experiences trauma, it implies there is something to be learned, thus we are stuck in that brokenness until we learn/Love our way out of it. \n\nWithout beliefs and with pure presence/observance (to purely observe would be to look at an object without having your mind project any image...you are seeing what is actually there, without projection), you see the world as it truly is. On some level, we all feel anxiety and sadness until we discover our true being, as opposed to \u2018false being\u2019 (projecting ideas from your consciousness, out to the world, which strips the subject from seeing truth). And to exist in your \u2018true being\u2019, you must let go of all beliefs and just observe.\n\nEdit: sorry, you didn\u2019t ask for me to write that. But I just had an urge to share my thoughts :)", "created_utc": 1586635366.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn471vv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fz7g4z", "parent_id": "t1_fn41283", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_37lis", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn471vv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/C_S_T/comments/fz7g4z/i_hate_this_stupid_5g_causes_coronavirus/fn471vv/"}
