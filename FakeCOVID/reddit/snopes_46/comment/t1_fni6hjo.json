It is difficult to run a scientific study on a working farm, so there may be other environmental factors at play. However, the dairy cow study cites multiple other papers that also point towards there being some negative health outcomes for livestock and people around towers.\n\nObviously none  of this *proves* that cellular towers are causing the negative health impacts. But on the flip side I can\u2019t find studies saying that the towers are perfectly safe.   Unfortunately we have to wait and hope that more studies are published that can give clarity to the problem. \n\nAll that To say, people shouldn\u2019t be out there tearing down the towers because they think it\u2019s causing a virus.  Thats just dumb had not how viruses work. But I won\u2019t dismiss someone outright  if they live/work near a tower and report negative effects to themselves or their animals.", "created_utc": 1586974800.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fni6hjo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnhweur", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fni6hjo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fni6hjo/"}
