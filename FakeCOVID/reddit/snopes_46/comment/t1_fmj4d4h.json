The signals don't go through anything so if you don't have direct line of sight to a transmission box, it's worthless. Even a tree will block it with its leaves. Your head will block it if it's held on the other side of your face. Not to mention the range is absolute garbage.\n\nWith all of that, you would have to have them everywhere. In your house you would need one in every room. Imagine if your wifi didn't go through walls. You MIGHT get good use out of them in places like sport stadiums, but that's pretty much it.\n\n\nThere are places in this country without 3G, let alone 4G. Now we are talking about this extreme short range technology getting wide adoption? It's a pipe dream. The number of people you would need to maintain the boxes when they break would be absolutely crazy.\n\nAlso there are also concerns that, because of the frequency used, it would interfere with weather forecasting.\n\nThis doesn't even touch on the questionable health concerns. Are there real concerns or is it just conspiracy theory nonsense? I have no idea but I haven't seen enough good information to make that call personally. It sounds like it's tin foil hat stuff, but I think it's worth the due diligence before littering our country with them.", "created_utc": 1586122780.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj4d4h", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmj34l2", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj4d4h", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmj4d4h/"}
