As the mechanism it can kill cells is with heat. What happens is that water, being H2O moves around when receiving these photons. Which causes it to bang into each other and thus heat. That's why glass heats up significantly less than water. \n\nBut a microwave projects a field that is between 350-750W . On a box that reflects the radiation, has constructive interference and all that so most of that energy is used. Your AP can't legally exceed 25-50mW \n\nThe most powerful 4G antenna is 45W. The most powerful 5G antenna is 140W (the normal is 15-25W) . \n\nTheir power decays following the I = P / 4piR^2 formula. (Not exactly as there are a few more effects into play such as reflection, not being completely spherical) \n\nFor a wave to be able to kill a cell there must either be enough energy as to kill it with heat. Or said particles have to have at least 12.4 eV . Have a chart for photons \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum\n\nOf course there are still Betta and alpha radiation but we aren't using that .", "created_utc": 1587200425.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnrt04z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3bunr", "parent_id": "t1_fnrjldv", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3ecey", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnrt04z", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/PhonesAreBad/comments/g3bunr/coronavirus5g/fnrt04z/"}
