No amount of research studies has yet proven this technology is completely unharmful either. Scientists argue that the emission of nonionizing radiation from those base stations might mostly affect human skin and environment. \u00a0In one research article\u00a0The human skin as a sub-THz receiver \u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\u00a0by Betzalela et al, the conclusion is the following: \u201cThere is enough evidence to suggest that the combination of the helical sweat duct and wavelengths approaching the dimensions of skin layers could lead to non-thermal biological e\ufb00ects. Such fears should be investigated and these concerns should also e\ufb00ect the de\ufb01nition of standards for the application of 5G communications.\u201c Therefore, even though Mr Lukani\u0107 reffers to an appeal that has dubious research files in the reference list, the potential of harmful effects of 5G technology should be taken into account as a valid concern.\u00a0", "created_utc": 1586195513.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmlyied", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvu8ql", "parent_id": "t1_fmlvw27", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2yrq6", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmlyied", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/PublicFreakout/comments/fvu8ql/british_5g_towers_are_being_set_on_fire_because/fmlyied/"}
