How is it possible something that doesn\u2019t have the ability to be harmful needs more testing done to establish the truth? \n\nAnother thing I wanted to add is when people in your family tell you to \u201cdo research\u201d it\u2019s probably not a \u201cwe know more than you\u201d type thing. It\u2019s that it\u2019s very easy for people who have followed nothing but government guidelines/officials stats can sometimes be wrong, or not aware of the larger play at hand. You took that personally, yet I know many people who are experts in their fields and will tell you they learn new things all the time. Unless you specifically were involved in the invention and production of 5G (like Mark Steele was and who now speaks out about 5g) you\u2019re just reading things/being told how it all works from someone you don\u2019t know, or even know if they are telling the truth. So at best both sides of the argument have to assume a fair bit, right?", "created_utc": 1586082729.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmhjhbt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t1_fmh66zf", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmhjhbt", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmhjhbt/"}
