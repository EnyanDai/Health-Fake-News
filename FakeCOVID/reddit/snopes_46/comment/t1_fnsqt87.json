Analogue TV that has been around for decades, your talking perhaps 20-150 killowatts from a network broadcast mast.    \n\n5G bands, now on the same frequencys (660 - 850 Mhz) that was used for analogue tv frequancies - about 10-60 watts, used for more rural areas with ranges of up to 8-10 km, and for the 2.3 Ghz -60 Ghz - no more than 60 watts, with ranges from 1.5km to 200m roughly. To attain the required new data speeds while maintaining low latancy and low power (what the new generation, 5G scope defines), masts are distributed only hundreds of feet apart. \n\nThat's still so weak that signal strenght is too low to operate more than this distance where it's becomes lost to background noise. (the dB drops below threshold levels to maintain minimum signal quality). This is why they are configured in a mesh array across heavily populated areas, as they simply don't have the energy in its modulation to penetrate walls or city infrastructre enough to ensure peoples phones and other devices can actually connect and receive any where near the bandwidth (speed) advertised. \n\nAlso, look out for people using words like \"saturated\" to imply we are being \"bombarded with high levels of radiation\", simple ignorance. If you look at 'About' in settings in your phone under Network status you can see the current signal strenght the phone is receiving, as its read in -dB, numbers closer to zero are better, mines currenty poor enough at -105 dBm or 35asu. I'd have a much faster connection speed if it read -80 - -70 dBm. If my signal strength drops to somewhere around - 112dBm - - 115 dBm, I believe, my phone will change to the 3G frequency bands as it can no longer provide adequate signal strenght and quality of 4G, and I'm only 2.5km from my nearest providers 4G mast.", "created_utc": 1587227031.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsqt87", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnsdfb1", "score": 33, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587231903.0, "name": "t1_fnsqt87", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnsqt87/"}
