At the same time, implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires a fundamental transformation of the economy and society. So what could be more appropriate than to harness the momentum of digitalization to launch decisive stimuli for the Transformation towards Sustainability? What interventions and collaborations does this require? And what are the risks if such a technological revolution is not properly monitored? The world society is only gradually beginning to discuss such questions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Core messages of the flagship report \u2018Our Common Digital Future\u2019](https://www.wbgu.de/fileadmin/user_upload/wbgu/publikationen/factsheets/fs7_2019/wbgu_fs1-2019_en.pdf)\n\n>**\"The future of Homo sapiens\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those who like \"**Club of Rome**\" articles, I recommend:\n\n>On December 11, 2019, the Co-PRESIDENT of the global Club of Rome, Ms. Sandrine Dixson-Decl\u00e8ve, wrote a letter to EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen (who, by the way, was never chosen by us) and sent her that of the Club of Rome formulated text for the \"Green New Deal\", which she would have to take over \"word for word\".\n\nSadly the original pdf of the letter has been removed from the CoR site, and is not available on the internet archive either.  Luckily I made a copy, that you can find [here](http://www.filedropper.com/egdcoropenletter-1).  *With apologies for the lame hosting*.\n\n[Emerging new Civilization](https://clubofrome.org/impact-hubs/emerging-new-civilization/)\n\n[Emerging from the Emergency: Key Policy Recommendations to G20 Leaders](https://clubofrome.org/impact-hubs/climate-emergency/emerging-from-the-emergency-key-policy-recommendations-to-g20-leaders/)\n\n[The European Green New Deal](https://krisenfrei.com/der-european-green-new-deal-der-club-of-rome-und-die-befehlsempfaengerin-ursula-von-derleyen/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And of course, let us finally tie it all together with the Mother of all Documents**\n\n[THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/21252030%20Agenda%20for%20Sustainable%20Development%20web.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom these links you should be able to see how **5G** roll-out fits into these plans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn order to build this future society, we must base it on a common and solid low-latency, high-speed digital infrastructure.\n\nIf we want fully automated delivery vehicles and drones moving around, taking the place of traditional workers, they need millimeter accuracy with super high bandwidth, low-latency connections between themselves, base-stations, individuals, and each other.\n\nIf we want a society where local resources are used more efficiently, with less waste, and giving preference to that which is around us, then we also need this infrastructure.\n\nThe idea is to pivot toward a new digital economy that is more sustainable, better for the planet, that is centered on known good basic human values and beliefs.\n\nThere will undoubtedly be many concessions and much reorientation that need to take place along this path.\n\nPeople \\*will\\* die, but the question seems open regarding the cost/benefit payoff.  If you subscribe to the premise of the project, the idea is that less people will die in the longer term.\n\nThe question for us as a species is to ask if this is what we want.\n\nIt is also for us to be conscious and observant that many issues are seen to be conflated in this goal.  Many Governments, large organizations and corporations stand to profit during the turmoil of change.\n\nSo we should not be blind going into this future; which is after all, why I'm sharing this.\n\nHow to react is up to each individual; but at least the plan is for all to see.\n\n*Perhaps others with more energy can pick up from here and spearhead the creation of separate post(s) from this.*\n\n**tl;dr:  Take a look at the first link**\n\n\\[edit: formatting\\]", "created_utc": 1587034830.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnkog9o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1trvy", "parent_id": "t3_g1trvy", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587035538.0, "name": "t1_fnkog9o", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/g1trvy/the_coronavirus_is_caused_by_5g_is_a/fnkog9o/"}
