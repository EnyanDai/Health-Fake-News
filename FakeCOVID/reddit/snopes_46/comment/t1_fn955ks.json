We don\u2019t need to test to know that. This is the electromagnetic spectrum we\u2019re talking about here. We\u2019ve been highly familiar with it for a long time. We know what\u2019s dangerous and what isn\u2019t. Going lower power is inherently less harmful, not more. Anybody who\u2019s spent 30 seconds in a chemistry class knows that 5G at the power, frequency, and amplitude for cell service is incapable of physical harm. It doesn\u2019t have nearly enough energy to hurt anything. We know this to be as true as well as we know that bears shit in the woods. \n\nThat is why there are no tests as you claim. Because a negative outcome would defy the basic laws of physics and chemistry.
