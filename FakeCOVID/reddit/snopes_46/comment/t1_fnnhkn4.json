It's not up to someone to prove a negative - that's impossible. You can't prove that something doesn't exist. It's up to skeptics to do the research and prove something does exist, ie. higher cancer rates at 5G towers. Our current understanding of physics and cellular biology indicate that the local heating effects are the primary concern for humans, and 5G technology has been proven ad nauseam to not cause local heating nor cancer. That doesn\u2019t prove 5G causes no adverse health effects, but like I said, that\u2019s impossible to do. If I told you \u201cwe are certain that cell phones don\u2019t kill us\u201d you\u2019d probably agree. But when some study comes along and says \u201cbut cell phones release 0.000003 ppm of neon into the atmosphere, and neon can kill us\u201d then any study we\u2019ve done to \u201cprove\u201d that cell phones can\u2019t kill us become moot. \nNot one reputable, replicable research study has proven that 5G *does* cause health issues. In vitro studies, questionable at that, have shown *effects* on cells by 5G MMR. Thos effects are undetermined to actually be negative. Those studies mostly pertain to cell permeability, in vitro. The problem is, not one study has been able to extrapolate this to demonstrate a negative effect on humans. \nLet\u2019s put it this way; standing near campfire has an *effect* on cells, but standing next to a campfire won\u2019t cause you to explode into flames. Yet these are exactly the types of conclusions being drawn from extremely indeterminate studies. It\u2019s irresponsible to jump to those conclusions, especially seeing as how we\u2019ve got a pretty damn good understanding of science and none of it points to 5G causing harm. That\u2019s not to say we know everything, but jumping to the extreme opposite end and saying \u201cprove it\u2019s safe\u201d is really difficult when researchers release practically irrelevant in vitro studies that conspiracy theorists will latch onto like the holy grail of validation.", "created_utc": 1587092536.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnnhkn4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnnd26s", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnnhkn4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnnhkn4/"}
