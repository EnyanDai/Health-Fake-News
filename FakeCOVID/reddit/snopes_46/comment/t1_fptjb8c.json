I wouldn't want to right now with the crazy that's unleashed itself out there.  \n\nMany of the techs I worked with in the field, even though it was against policy, kept a firearm in their vehicle under the seat.  Most sites are relatively safe, but there are locations that are sketchy by default and carry some sort of risk whenever you have to visit.  Some required police escort and waiting whenever you worked on them, and only during daylight hours as Law Enforcement often wouldn't hang out after dark in those locations, and that meant you shouldn't either.   \n\n\nThe gulf of idiocy that's opened about the (5G) technology and the false claims of it causing CV19 just baffles the fuck out of me.  I shake my head at the death of reason and intelligence in the human population.  We've failed to educate our populace, and we've allowed (at least in the US) for ignorance to become not only the norm, but something people are proud of.  I wish I knew what could stem the tide of idiocy, but it seems to be overwhelming.  I would like to hope that enough of these idiots kill themselves off by contracting the disease and eliminating themselves from the gene pool.  But that puts other innocent people at risk in many areas, and it's unfortunate.", "created_utc": 1588892304.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptjb8c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t3_gfbygc", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptjb8c", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptjb8c/"}
