It tells you instantly that the person does not understand what separates a fact from an opinion. They think it is all relative and literally everything is up for debate because they are the chosen few that have found the truth. Their extensive youtube research means that they have a degree in everything and their voice means as much as anyone else. \n\nWhere I work I run into these kinds of people a lot and I have found that the best way to get their mind to open up a little is to play into their pessimism. I'll acknowledge the tiny kernels of truth of whatever the conspiracy of the day holds and what was wrong about so and so thing. Then I'll break out the Socratic method and ask question after question on what they think would be the motivation for this conspiracy, the details of how could something like it be pulled off, who is profiting from this and how would they collect etc etc. I have found that the majority of the time people simply do not understand how any bureaucracy actually works or what a real cover up would look like. Oddly, conspiracy people tend to have a lot more faith in governments locking down the truth then I would ever give them.", "created_utc": 1586158451.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkku0w", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmke68a", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkku0w", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmkku0w/"}
