So I wouldn't look to his intelligence as even being a factor in regard to his ability to form a reasonable world view. The two just simply don't always go hand in hand.\n\nWhy do we believe what we believe? Either because of personal experience, or more often simply because we trusted someone.\n\nSome of what he believes might be true. Not saying that from the perspective of \"maybe you should listen to him\". I'm just saying that often what leads to outlandish conspiracy theories is information that starts out true.\n\nTalk to your dad and find out why he believes what he does and see if you can actually substantiate anything as true, and figure where the disconnects are; where the truth gets twisted.\n\nSuppose something is 10% true and 90% false. You have to address the 10% first and validate it. Otherwise the other person will keep going there in their mind (even if they don't specifically bring it up as a defense). And if you've rejected the 10% just because you assume it's false based on the other 90% then you'll never get anywhere. But once you identify and validate the things that actually are true, then it becomes way, way easier to reason because the other person now knows that you are taking them seriously and can relate to them.", "created_utc": 1587544740.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo6356r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "parent_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo6356r", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskDocs/comments/g5fyvm/my_very_smart_dad_has_recently_started_reading/fo6356r/"}
