How TF do you know. It's hard to trust anything in the media. Blindy accepting what your told as truth makes you more stupid than anyone else. People who question the narrative that is being pushed to us shouldn't be looked down upon. It makes people fear to question what they are told. Which is a good thing. But it's cool to make fun of those who don't buy into what everyone else is thinking. And that's just BS. Even if we are wrong about something it's we shouldn't be put down for thinking it. It makes it easier for lies to spread and keeps people shut up about what they actually believe for fear of being made fun of if they are wrong.", "created_utc": 1587710373.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "foepf7u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g6vp2j", "parent_id": "t3_g6vp2j", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi1r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_foepf7u", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/meme/comments/g6vp2j/if_you_think_5g_towers_caused_coronavirus_your/foepf7u/"}
