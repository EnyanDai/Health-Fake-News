More like our universe and at lest once other are crossing paths / merging. \n\nWhich it's it? BOTH. Quantum world works weird like that. Lemme try to explain:\n\nAs your timeline crosses over and/or combines with others and the system harmonizes again after the flux. Then it's another 2700 years (give or take a few hundred) of relative stability regarding time.\n\nThe best part is since the result has already occurred we're just on a ride from here to there. Some religions and people call this an apocalypse, and I mean it kinda is, an age has ended, so yeah. But it's not literally the end of all life blah blah blah.\n\nImagine if you are an old star gazing math using thinker of any old age, and you figure out that history basically says \"yo, every so often this crazy thing happens\" and now you, as a thinking person have to go explain to the masses that crazy shit will happen a thousand years away. \n\nYou'll be called crazy until you can predict something sooner, then you're a god or witch or whatever dumb people jump to. EXACT same shit happening, we're told \"yeah so maybe around 2000 or 2012 or so some crazy shit is gonna happen, JUST A HEADS UP\" and we, being dumb scared animals went \"WHAT?!?! Everything gonna die?!?!?!? OH GOD, PRAY TO ALL THE GODS, FUCK IT\" Even though no, the less you prepare the more will die but no, not everyone, WE SURVIVE, calm your tits ya dummies.\n\nSo like I said, the event already happened, in the quantum realm, now we are in the state where it transfers from quantum to our 3d universe. So the event was instant, but relatively to us we'll be riding this wave for a while. I think of it as these energies harmonizing, syncing up, like those clacker balls or metronomes do.\n\nSo my final thought here: CALM YA TITS.", "created_utc": 1586939409.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngos1m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngdzil", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngos1m", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngos1m/"}
