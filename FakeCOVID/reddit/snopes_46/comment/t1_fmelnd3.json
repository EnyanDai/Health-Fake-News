Not sure what that's supposed to say.\n\n>9/11 conspiracies,\n>moon landing conspiracies\n\nAre they? Never seen a left or right wing thing here. In fact I've seen most moon landing conspiracy theorists are more left-wing, liberal types\n\n>NWO conspiracies\n\nVauge. Again never seen this particularly either way. There are left-wingers who believe the same sorts of things just different terminology.\n\nMany left-wingers believe in bizarre conspiracy theories about the right wing establishment of \"media, academia and government\" all as one collective entity to work together.\n\nMany communists or socialists believe in all sorts of conspiracies about right wingers.\n\nThere's just as many anti-Semitic, Israel conspiracies by the left than right.\n\nMost left-wingers believe vast conspiracy theories about Russia that are based on literally no evidence (no that's not \"defending Putin).
