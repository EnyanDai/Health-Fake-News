If something is illegal to question, it should be the first thing for you to question. Why did all of the concentration camps liberated by the allies end up not being death camps? Why only those liberated by the communist USSR? Was the USSR a good source for truth?\n\nWhy did France and England declare war on Germany for invading Poland? Why didn't they do the same for the USSR? Why were jews all over the world boycotting and pushing for war against Germany in the 1930's? Why did Germany only manage to deport 50,000 jews over a ten year period, but were able to gas 11 million within 3 years?\n\nDid you know Britain accused Germany of gassing people in ww1 and later apologized for the war time propaganda? Did you know Patton never said a word about death camps in his notes? Did you know Patton said \"we have fought the wrong enemy\"? Did you know Germany wasn't the only country to invade the USSR? Did you know the allies subjected the most of europe to brutal communism and genocide for 40 fucking years?\n\nseriously, fuck you for being brain dead.", "created_utc": 1586317576.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmra5d4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t1_fmr957w", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmra5d4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmra5d4/"}
