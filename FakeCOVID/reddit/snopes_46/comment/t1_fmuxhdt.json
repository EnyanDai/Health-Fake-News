I'm not trying to be right; I want to know the truth. I have a lot of people to protect and attend to, and I want to make the right decisions if, y'know, if my family has unexplained illnesses and/or if tanks are rolling down my street.\n\nBecause you work in the telecoms world might give you a little credence in my \"world view,\" but I also wouldn't trust any U.S. senator or representative to tell me anything about the Constitution right now; whatever's on your business card is just part of it.\n\nThere is enough evidence that the radiation from existing routers, SmartMeters\u00ae and possibly satellites is harmful \u2013 and I'm talking about weaponized satellites, not standard communication versions, as we've possibly seen as DEWs causing the various forest fires globally (which might have been aircraft, but I haven't seen anyone who's decided either way). There has also been suggestions on this sub that Musk's Starlink shit could be involved in directing/focusing various frequencies to targeted areas and people. I'll totally concede that the ranges for 5G won't carry from a communications satellite, and the satellite weaponry theories may have nothing to do with 5G (but the timing...).\n\nTo your point \"The specialist equipment needed to be installed for this has only recently entered the market.\" What are you talking about specifically? It sounds like you're making my point by referring to tech that isn't common knowledge.
