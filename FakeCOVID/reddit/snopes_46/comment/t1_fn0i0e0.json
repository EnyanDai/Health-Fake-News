First of all, not American. Second, the US is not the end result of communism.\n\nYou said that capitalist China was the end result of communism. Why isn't capitalist USA then the end result of communism then? Is it because USA has by far the most prisoners in the world? Is that what makes USA not communist? Is it USA's concentration camps that makes it not communist? Is it its torture centres around the world that makes USA not communist? Is it its assassinations that makes it not communist? Is it USA's support of terrorism that makes it not communist? Is it USA's overthrowing of democracies around the world that makes it not communist? What is the difference that makes China \"the end result\" of communism and not USA?\n\n> It's openly discussed in America what their policies have done, what their actions have done.\n\nIt's absolutely not. Mentioning any of it is a social death sentence in USA, and it's so little discussed that 95+% of Americans have absolutely no fucking clue what the fuck their country is responsible for.", "created_utc": 1586542301.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn0i0e0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fn0au67", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn0i0e0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fn0i0e0/"}
