Of course, this isn't nearly the first time this has happened. In the days when Melbourne's biggest and least honest paper was called The Truth, the New York Times became the world's biggest newspaper because it was the only one that printed consistently true news. Fast forward a bit and you have dictators calling the press the Enemy of the People. The average person didn't believe it, because good newspapers with necessary information had cultivated enormous goodwill with the public, but *the average person tolerated the slander.* That made all the difference. It made the propaganda legitimate.\n\nNow those publications are gone and we're getting our news from the same place as we did in Medieval times: Neighbours and people who make us feel warm and fuzzy about the universe. People we believe speak for something bigger, whether it's government secrets or the aliens who send messages into your chakras. We're in the same place as our ancestors were when they tortured cats for being the devil's familiars, or executed witches for making the village trip on wheat mould, or accused Bill Gates of spreading Coronavirus to muscle into the highly unprofitable vaccine trade. Wait, that last one is us.\n\nThe point is that neoliberal executives tore apart the hard news because there's more money in opinion columns, and now they routinely buttfuck each other with dishonest business practices at their and our expense. And that has led to your grandma scrounging around the information syringe-park of Facebook to get the answers we all need to survive.
