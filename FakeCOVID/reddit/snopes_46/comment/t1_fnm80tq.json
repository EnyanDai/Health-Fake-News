You said \"political class \". That's the point. A good voting system is one in which everyone has a say but where educated opinions have weight.\n\nMaybe the rich kid gets an education and becomes an expert in physical cosmology. Why would he vote against educating the masses? If you have more people well-versed in physics then the total number of votes from that bracket will be higher when, I don't know, deciding the budget allocated to his field or the funding for a new radio telescope.\n\nWho decides the quanta of votes. I don't know. Maybe some sort of certification system (for those that can't attend an university but acquired the knowledge from other sources - just to say, I'm in this group, I haven't finished my degree), attestations, your university, you published papers, your work history. The difference in voting shouldn't be that big. Most people will probably get between 1 and 10 votes. The cream of the crop should get 1000. I think it should be some sort of dynamic system that always changes.", "created_utc": 1587066698.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnm80tq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnm3lqw", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnm80tq", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnm80tq/"}
