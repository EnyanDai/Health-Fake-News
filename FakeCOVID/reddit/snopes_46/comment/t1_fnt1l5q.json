Like, at all. We are constantly being blasted by the same frequencies that 5G operates on due to higher frequency harmonics of lower frequency carrier signals from other radio equipment. Just because this is the first network that uses this frequency as a carrier, doesn't mean that it's the first time that humans are being exposed to this exact frequency of an EM wave.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're standing next to a 5G tower or if you're miles and miles away. You are still experiencing the same wavelengths as upper frequency harmonics from other radios. There is no such thing as a noise free transmitter.\n\nWe should be skeptical of new technology. 5G is not new technology. All it is is a new radio transmission standard, that's literally it. We have every reason to believe 5G is physically safe because we've been exposed to these exact wavelengths for decades, and we're fine.\n\nSource: took many fields classes in undergrad and took linear systems analysis, which explains what a Fourier transform is. Am electrical engineer. I'm not a toxicologist but I'm also not a loon\n\nEdit: Holy fuck I totally missed the middle part of this, man that is some crazy bullshit. You're smarter than believing that, I know you can be. No one is injecting dye into your skin, that's not worth anyone's time or money. They will probably just check your temp before walking into a store or restaurant, which I think is perfectly reasonable given the circumstances.
