Since 1988 he has led a team of researchers that have exposed thousands of laboratory rats to microwave radiation from various sources. Since the late 1990s they have used mobile telephones as the source of this radiation.\n\nTheir results have been consistent and alarming: not only does radiation from a cell phone damage the blood-brain barrier, but it does so at even when the exposure level is reduced a thousandfold. Even more disturbingly, and contrary to what was expected, the damage to the blood-brain barrier worsened when the experimenters reduced the exposure level. The implies that SAR ratings for cell phones may be worthless and that it may not be possible to make cell phones safer by reducing their power.\n\nIn laboratory rats, Salford\u2019s team has demonstrated that blood-brain barrier leakage occurs after only two minutes of exposure. Further, a single two-hour exposure to a cell phone, even at reduced power, was shown to damage or destroy up to two percent of an animal\u2019s brain cells.\n\nIn other experiments in Salford\u2019s laboratory, long term exposure of rats to a cell phone caused memory impairment, and a single six-hour exposure at extremely low power levels caused genetic damage. Exposure to a low-frequency magnetic field (low frequencies are also emitted by cell phones) caused disturbances of calcium transport in cells.\n\nSalford has called the use of cell phones by human beings \u201cthe largest biological experiment ever,\u201d and he calls the potential implications of his laboratory results \u201cterrifying.\u201d \u201cThose who might normally have got Alzheimer\u2019s dementia in old age could get it much earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps putting a mobile phone repeatedly to your head is something that might not be good in the long term.\u201d\n\n---\n\nBLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER PERMEABILITY IN RATS EXPOSED TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS USED IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION, 1997 https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/7520941992.pdf\n\nNERVE CELL DAMAGE IN MAMMALIAN BRAIN AFTER EXPOSURE TO MICROWAVES FROM GSM MOBILE PHONES Leif G.
