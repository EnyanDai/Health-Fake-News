It's not a question of forcing it or directly inflicting it, it will happen all on its own. The question is merely how much effort are you willing to put into preventing it, both from the perspective of resource expenditure as well as allowing collateral damage to those who were never party to the stupid decisions in the first place.\n\nChina is willing to seal doors shut to enforce quarantine laws and prevent the stupidity of people there from spreading the infection, but noone else is willing to resort to such measures. If we let the covidiots' stupidity call the shots, the suffering would be enormous, but it would change a lot of minds about appropriate safety measures. The suffering on those who have done nothing wrong would likewise be enormous though, and that's not a price they should have to pay. So the question is, how to best contain the consequences of stupidity to only affect those who would see the inevitable suffering of their goals brought about? And when do you simply consider the stupid to be unsalvageable and force them to behave appropriately regardless of what they want because the consequences are too dire otherwise?", "created_utc": 1588889322.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptdm8p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptbkgx", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptdm8p", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptdm8p/"}
