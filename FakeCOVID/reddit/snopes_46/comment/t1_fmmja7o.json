Selling a potentially dangerous product? Maybe... But tech? It's pretty simple to uncover the inner workings and details of amy technology invented, and no matter what any developer does to hide it, when it's given out to consumers, eventually someone will figure it out...\n\nSo in the case of 5G, let's pretend for a moment it actually is secretly very dangerous, here's the timeline for that:\n\n1) Companies research and develop a new cell radio frequency/service.\n2) During their research they discover it could actually \"microwave\" people and hurt them.\n3) Company says *fuck it* and rolls it out anyway.\n4) Consumers ignorant to the risks feverishly buy the products/services.\n5) *x* months later, hundreds of thousands of people report various physiological symptoms related to the hazards of harmful radio waves.\n6) A probe is launched and uncovers the 5G towers are causing the problem, and have injured everyone.\n7) Everyone who's suffered from this is now mounting lawsuits for compensation, the government (via the FCC) is demanding the towers be removed/disabled.\n8) The backlog of research about the potential harm the towers could cause is discovered/enters the mainstream. \n9) The company is now bleeding out money to pay for lawsuits, and paying workers to disassemble the towers.\n10) nobody trusts the companies anymore, and they lose profit as people jump ship to other providers that don't sell them harmful products.\n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1586206289.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmmja7o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmlgz24", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmmja7o", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmmja7o/"}
