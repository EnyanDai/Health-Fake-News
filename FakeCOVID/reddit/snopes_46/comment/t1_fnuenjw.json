Lastly yeah I worry about those allegation but I\u2019m for investigation unlike the right and I also can already tell the women\u2019s story is very flimsy with the story changing a hell of a lot. Plus Obamas campaign vetting didn\u2019t find this nor did the competition use that info against him when he ran with Obama. Seems really weird something from the 90\u2019s didn\u2019t come up through obamas vetting process. Literally everyone politician does this when picking a running mate. \n\nIf you truly are whining about voting for a rapist while redirecting that at Biden than you are naive given the allegations and times trump himself had bragged about sexual assault is way higher and frankly if it comes down to the number one guy doesn\u2019t mind creeping on kids. Has a girl who claims trump raped her at 13 and her allegations are backed up in the fact that she did know Epstein and trump was at the party the rape happen at. On top of raping his wife and saying he forces himself on women.", "created_utc": 1587260363.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnuenjw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntorbb", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnuenjw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnuenjw/"}
