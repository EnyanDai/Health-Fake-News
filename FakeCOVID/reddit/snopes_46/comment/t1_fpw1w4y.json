There are a lot of young people who have bought into this bullshit too.\n\nThe purely far right connection is also somewhat wishful thinking on the part of young educated liberals who would prefer to assign this to the other tribe and who don't have direct contact with these people most of the time.  There is a strain of left wing thought that's every bit as hostile to modern rationalism as anything the right could dream up, it's just that up until recently it's mostly been expressed in mostly benign ways.\n\nYes, the right wing mediasphere is a cesspool of conspiratorial thinking, but there is also a left wing/new age/back to the land/goop-reading/essential oil chugging element that's especially prominent in the anti-vax and now 5g groups.  The anti-vaxxers in particular started off in primarily left wing circles distrustful of \"Big Pharma\" and inculcated in new age feel good bullshit like homeopathy or astrology.    It's now spread to the far right, but it ain't partisan - some of the biggest hotspots of unvaccinated children and the resulting outbreaks were in ultra-liberal enclaves in CA.  The 5g thing seems to have almost directly emerged out of the anti-vax movement, as have the covid denialists.", "created_utc": 1588955816.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpw1w4y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt56yl", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpw1w4y", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpw1w4y/"}
