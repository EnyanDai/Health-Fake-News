All absolute crap.  The few tests that have been conducted are so poorly planned and using unrealistic power levels\nand irrelevant usage models (ie 30dBm @ an inch from rats 24/7 for months \u201coh, look!  the skin is warm!!!\u201d).  Just asinine.  And they think any of this concludes their \u201cfindings\u201d.  Unless you are cross disciplined in multiple fields of study from biology to RF engineering, at some point you\u2019re missing critical information that negates any of the unscientifically perceived risks.  \n\nLastly, these frequency spectrums for mmWave have already been in use\nfor DECADES by researchers and other microwave radio systems.  NONE of this is \u201cunexplored\u201d or experimental... not in the way they think this is.  If ANY subset of these risks that the foil hat crowd has screamed about for decades existed, myself and dozens of my colleagues (and most likely tens of thousands of tower climbing / cellular network engineers  and field techs globally) would have us all dead or dying of some horrible cancerous diseases YEARS ago.  We\u2019re exposed to HUNDREDS of times more RF energy at a multitude of frequencies every day of our jobs than anyone else on the planet.", "created_utc": 1587228746.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnstyre", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnspa60", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnstyre", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnstyre/"}
