{"author": {}, "body": "There is certainly a political aspect to totalitarian countries, like the lack of individual freedom and suppression of opposition. Things that generally aren't seen as politically correct in the west. That's what the person above was talking about when he/she responded to you saying companies invested in China because they thought it would be \"quite liberal\". That's the political aspect of the discussion, and we've seen time and time again that companies simply do not give a rats ass about that. Companies chase profit regardless of morals. \n\nAs with the stability aspect, as I said before, being totalitarian is just part of the equation and I think you are agreeing with me here on this aspect. Yes, companies cannot criticise the Chinese government and that would negatively impact a country's stability. However, compared to a democratic country with other problems, like let's say a history of bloody religious conflicts, the suppression of criticism barely moves the scale at all in determining a country's stability. In that case, companies will readily invest in China, that is predominately atheist and has a strict control on its population, even though its a totalitarian country. Stability is what they are looking for, and a country's political system is just one of the many factors.", "created_utc": 1586525630.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmznwa8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fmzlz7t", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586526378.0, "name": "t1_fmznwa8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fmznwa8/"}
