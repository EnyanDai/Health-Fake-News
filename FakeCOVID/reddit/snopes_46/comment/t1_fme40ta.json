Is this your first day on the internet? Do you react this way about all image edits online lol\n\nOf course it is insane. It is utterly insane. I generally assume that all images on the internet are utterly faked. For the very simple reason that there is more motive to edit an image than present an unedited image. The Law is actually quite pedantic about things such as libel and contempt of Court and Judges, unlike me, do treat images in this way. As if it were their first day on the Internet. Now I am never going to be in a position to hand down Judgements but they are.\n\nSo the question is not about if you think I am being a dickhead - *it does kind of seem clear that you would probably put me into the dickhead category if someone asked you, but that's fine* - the question is about what you think of expecting standards from the Internet. You say it is insane to suggest that people with genuine power might want standards that they approve of. I can see that attitude going badly wrong if you are not prepared to defend it in the future. Possibly the near future.\n\n> Look mate I'm not interested in taking a side in some big battle for or against against Rachel Riley, I'm saying that the image she posted is very clearly an edit and not deceptive.\n\nI am not asking you to. But, from your response, it seems you are aware that there *is* a *big battle* going on. It is a big battle that will, eventually, impact you. Because you will be unceremoniously told that \"this is the way it is\" because \"of the Rachel Riley judgement\". This is because UK Law works on precedent and formative opinions from those Judges. The ones I have already portrayed as being pedantic.\n\n> What? Yes I feel perfectly happy defending the view that that edited image of Corbyn is not deceptive\n\nSo you have already defaulted to taking sides. You have sided with Rachel Riley. There are people who have been deceived by the image but they do not matter to you. Because you are happy to defend the idea that the image is not deceptive. Which is fine. But you do have to say that you have taken sides. failure to do so is, in itself, deceptive.\n\nIt really is not about attacking you but about highlighting just how easy it is to change what people are allowed to think. Which is highly relevant to the 5G Coronavirus conspiracy theories: they all contribute to the most facile, idiotic way of thinking. They actively dumb down society so that people do not make critical, reasoned, judgements about the behaviour of people like Riley - and it is nothing personal against the woman, it could be anybody who rocks up to an idiot box near you and spouts their own opinions with all the authority that an Afternoon Quiz Show Contract now vests in people.\n\n>  I'm not interested in taking a side in some big battle for or against against Rachel Riley\n\nFor the record: nor am I. I really am not interested in pandering to celebrity egoes. But that is the world we find ourselves in. I appreciate that you have more sense than to want to take sides, but it seems Slackers are all being pushed to actually take sides.
