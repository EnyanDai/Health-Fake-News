Why are you commenting if you're that ignorant? I have been an RF engineer and it's crazy to me how people act so confident on these issues with zero understanding. A normal car radio transmits nothing, being near it is the same as being anywhere. The power decreases by 1 / distance^2 from the source so it only matters when you are very close to the transmitting antennae, like a cellphone next to your brain. The base stations transmit with an order of magnitude or two more power but that's fine as no one is right next to them. WiFi from a phone doesn't really matter either because it's such low power which is why the range is short. But a transmitting 4g device putting out 5W very close to a childs brain could cause a measurable change in temperature, we don't know if that's ok long term. 5g is likely lower power than 3g or LTE and higher frequency so it's less of an issue.", "created_utc": 1586603979.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn2un63", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyudtd", "parent_id": "t1_fn2thrd", "score": -9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn2un63", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/fyudtd/coronavirus_conspiracies_like_that_bogus_5g_claim/fn2un63/"}
