At the same time I will obviously add the study to the pthers. Some might be honest but most of the pigs have their face in the slurry. Plenty of scientists disagree and think it needs further testing though, ones without a vested interest. That was interesting though. Will see if it matches up with other studies.  Their is a lot of money involved in this which always complicates things.  Plenty of unsafe things get passed because of money. \nLook at the pharmaceutical industry full of harmful drugs or using the public as test subjects for them. Governments pushing unsafe drugs because of back handers from big pharma..\n History shows governments can lie about these things and nobody finds out for years. What's safe and unsafe changes all the time when new studies emerge so will scan them all before making a decision. \nPersonally I'm funny even with WiFi etc as I'm one of the people who is sensitive to electromagnetic stuff. Can't sleep if I leave my router on etc as I can hear and feel it. \nSome are more sensitive to things than other obviously. Not saying it's doing damage just I can feel it. \nThanks for the links though will add it to my list of studies I'm compiling now.", "created_utc": 1586671077.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn5oye2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyszf4", "parent_id": "t1_fn5en3b", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586671993.0, "name": "t1_fn5oye2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fyszf4/5g_is_not_linked_to_the_coronavirus_pandemic_in/fn5oye2/"}
