So should science be forced to prove it isnt? *Can* you prove it isnt? Everything we know about the science says it *shouldnt* be harmful. The experts in the field believe it isnt harmful. There are significantly more studies suggesting it is safe. Much like all those other similar technologies you listed. \n\nAnd yet, here we are splitting hairs about something that has zero evidence to your argument, and to mine - evidence through lack of evidence in yours. \n\nHeres the fallacy of conspiracy theories: You cant prove something *isnt*. If i said you like to dance like a maniac when no one is looking, you'd have no way to prove that you dont. So I can say that all day, to everyone I see, and you'd have no way to prove otherwise. \n\nThe studies conducted have shown no evidence that 5G EMF frequencies have caused any damage to anything. The study we're discussing is obviously trying to defend itself despite its negative results. \"Hypothesis\"  and \"Might\" are science for \"we cant prove anything but we want it to be true\". That doesnt count. Again, I could do a \"study\" right now and say 5G \"might\" give me super powers. You cant prove me wrong, and all I have to say is \"just wait and see\". \n\nUltimately, delaying major technological developments that can revolutionize almost every aspect of our day to day lives because some people guess that maybe it could possibly, one day, maybe effect organic material to a completely unknown degree is just not reasonable. \n\nI promise you more lives will be saved through the medical and scientific advancements this brings, then lives will be lost to 5G EMF radiation.", "created_utc": 1586288529.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmpwc5p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmpae0q", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmpwc5p", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmpwc5p/"}
