[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw\\_man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)    \n\n\nReligions are based on peoples lacking ability to think rationally and critically.   \nScience is not exclusively based on critical thinking, lots of skilled scientists have contributed to human knowledge while still lacking true critical thinking skills. Heck the guy touted as the smartest man in modern history did not accept quantum theory based on the idea that he didnt think god played dice with the universe.   \n\n\nReal scientists assume that what is not yet known is unknown, religion have allways claimed to hold the truth of what is beyond current knowledge and when science pushes they have retreated every step and just marked the next unknown as divine territory.   \nI mean its pretty obvious, the bible literally claims that god made the world in 6 days and made a woman out of a mans rib. After centuries of science that position has become impossible to hold so nowadays its \"god causing the big bang\" and \"evolution guided by the holy spirit\". Literally the definiton of goalpost moving.   \n\n\nAgain, try to read before you decide what strawmans you feel like attacking.", "created_utc": 1586162585.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkoo85", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmj2lr9", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkoo85", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmkoo85/"}
