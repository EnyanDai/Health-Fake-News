But FEs actively dispute science because it doesn\u2019t align with their view of the earth.  And that\u2019s a dangerous road, because as we\u2019ve seen time and again, that same group then promotes other anti-science ideas that do the world and society a disservice.  Questioning the results of experiments and hypothesis are critical to the process.  But disputing science just for the sake of being a contrarian and belonging to a group is detrimental to us all.  \n\nYou had people doubt that Corvid-19 was real, then groups saying it was man made and released, then 5G antennas are spreading the virus, and on and on.  At the end of the day, it reduces our ability to advance because we are constantly seeing these conspiracy people that \u201cknow the truth\u201d that make people that don\u2019t know any better start to doubt scientific reason.", "created_utc": 1586248494.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmo7par", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmo1bm6", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmo7par", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmo7par/"}
