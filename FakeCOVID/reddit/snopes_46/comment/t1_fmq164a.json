For the purpose of explaining this, there are two types of radiation. (There are quite a few more and some we don't understand.) These are ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Ionizing meaning it can physically affect you at the molecular level (Hence the DNA restructuring bullshit people like this guy spit out). 5G radio waves are **Non-Ionizing,** meaning there is no adverse effect directly on you at the cellular level.\n\nThe real concern with 5G is the **volume** of radio waves being emitted. Private firms like Xfinity want to install 5G boxes to have total coverage of populated areas. Basically a box every 10-50 ft. In cities and areas with dense infrastructure and population, this will raise the level of interactions between your cells and the outside environment. Although it is non-ionizing radiation with no direct harm, your cells still have a recorded interaction. At the volume's proposed in cities like San Franciscio, NY, Beijing, etc. this would almost certainly raise cancer rates as your cells would have a higher thermodynamic load than our bodies are used to. This is why you may have seen in the news San Francisco postponed citywide 5G until they can get the installation mapping correct.\n\nTL;DR: This guy and most speak bullshit, but 5G does present some issues.", "created_utc": 1586290996.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmq164a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwkcwo", "parent_id": "t1_fmou9c0", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 1, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmq164a", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwkcwo/youtube_tightens_rules_after_david_icke_5g/fmq164a/"}
