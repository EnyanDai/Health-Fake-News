If the Russians were that good why didn't they orchestrate things to end up with no-deal and maximum chaos? They certainly tried.\n\nThe fact that Brexit did happen is just the cherry on top as far as Russia is concerned, a happy little accident for them, but still an accident.", "created_utc": 1587237145.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnt9da0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3iinm", "parent_id": "t1_fnsx73n", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnt9da0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/g3iinm/uk_moves_to_drop_huawei_as_5g_vendor_citing_china/fnt9da0/"}
