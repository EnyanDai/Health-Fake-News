Just because you find solace in a conspiracy theory that seemingly helps explain the world in your head, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true.\n\nCoronavirus and 5G aren\u2019t part of the same conversation. Period. A virus works in a very specific way, as do different kinds of waves that vibrate at different frequencies. A simple understanding of the way you\u2019re even able to type your messages out to the world would help you through a lot of this. \n\nLastly, you conspiracy theorists all seem to forget that the people who work at these companies, from entry level to the c-suite, have families and lives of their own, so you need to consider what benefit it\u2019d be to them to screw the whole world up like that. \n\nMoney isn\u2019t always the answer here, and neither are your YouTube videos and health blogs.", "created_utc": 1586061276.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmgyg79", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t1_fmg03fg", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmgyg79", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmgyg79/"}
