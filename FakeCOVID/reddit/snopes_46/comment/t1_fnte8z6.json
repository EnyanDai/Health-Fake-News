I think it's safe to say you are a critical thinker. I think we are a dying breed and we might be at a crossroad of evolution. I think it is likely there are many intelligent beings out in that massive universe that have been at this crossroad before. We have innate issues that are destroying us. Its not a topic, it's how we think on a base level. We need to change some of those protocols or trains of thought. I think there are only three real possibilities in our future. One, we destroy ourselves debating over topics and ignore and never admit our innate issues that are the variable that is truely fucking us. Two, we conquer the innate flaws in time to continue on and likely walk the brighter path. Three, we augment these flaws with AI, likely the most dangerous path.", "created_utc": 1587239897.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnte8z6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntd3gt", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnte8z6", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnte8z6/"}
