I believe that they are expecting to be cut off from the outside internet at some point because of their constant interference and misinformation campaigns. They must be expecting \"let's just cut off Russia\" as being a potential blowback of their actions.", "created_utc": 1586944512.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngtmur", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngt4nj", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngtmur", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngtmur/"}
