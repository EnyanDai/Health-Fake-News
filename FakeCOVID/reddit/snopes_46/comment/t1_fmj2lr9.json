A political straw man is an example of a person/ people of certain group acting in a certain way so you can portray that group in a negative way and therefore portray their views as negative. The only group I talked about was religions whom I\u2019m supporting and didn\u2019t say anything negative about them. \n\nBecause your so confused I\u2019ll run through the conversation again. \n\nYou said religions wouldn\u2019t want people to be rational I disagreed stating that religions are rational all the time and accept scientific studies, I used scientific studies as an example because we were talking about misinformation surrounding 5Gs affects on human biology and how people should be more scientifically informed to think rationally. \n\nYou then said when religions do that they are moving goalposts. \n\n\nI called you a hypocrite for saying that religions who are rational and reinterpret their texts based on scientific studies are actually moving goal posts but when other people do it that\u2019s okay. \n\nThen you went off saying I\u2019m confusing and creating strawmans which I think are excuses for the fact you don\u2019t have anything else to say.", "created_utc": 1586121772.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj2lr9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmj0d0d", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj2lr9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmj2lr9/"}
