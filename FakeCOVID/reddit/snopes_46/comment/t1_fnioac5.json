You're making supposition and stating them as facts and I am free to disagree.\n\nI believe they didn't/don't care because they know hurting education isn't going to damage them in the long run, but I don't think they make laws expecting to see the outcome 20 years later, when the bad educated childrens become voters. I believe bad education systems in the western world is a consequence of politicians neglecting it because it doesn't bring votes or because the damage done isn't going to be directly noticed by the population.\n\nTo be fair, you brought up the republican party, but I'm not from the US and I'm talking more generically, since I believe this accusation is made everywhere. So if you want to point me to something that shows how the republican party did this or aimed to do this, go ahead and I will consider changing my opinion.", "created_utc": 1586983455.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnioac5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnidrov", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586983686.0, "name": "t1_fnioac5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnioac5/"}
