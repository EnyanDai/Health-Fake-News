Probably.\n\nYes I know, we cant give a platform to conspiracy theorists because it encourages them etc. It's all fun and games until the conspiracy theorist turns out to be correct.\n1 month ago they were delisting people who went against the WHOS official narrative on the coronavirus and it remains to be seen how much damage that will turn out. \"It's just the flu\", \"masks don't work\" \"just wash your hands\", just the thought of it makes me angry. \n\nHow about youtube don't decide what I can and can't watch? Long story short I'm starting to think that allowing conspiracy theorists to have a voice is less damaging then suppressing critically true information (like in the case of Covid) which will could lead to a complete loss of faith in government and trusted insititutions.", "created_utc": 1586121736.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj2jfo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t3_fvf99x", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj2jfo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmj2jfo/"}
