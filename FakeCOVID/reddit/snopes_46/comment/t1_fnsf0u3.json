Most people aren't going to investigate everything someone says; so they'll just take people like him at his word because he says it with a tone of authority, a level of confidence that presents itself as \"I know what I'm talking about\" even though he's actually lying and doing so to try and further his point.\n\n[An interview on Irish TV showed exactly his routine and it blowing up in his face because the presenter knew he was lying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKX70oRLws0).\n\nCompared with say [this instance on BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjVj3Xr6cVI&list=WL&index=10&t=60s) where he lies about same-sex marriage being legalised in the UK would result in churches being sued due to the ECHR.  He says it with a tone of authority and no one questions him on it.  Despite it being a lie.\n\nBut this Lisbon treaty 2020; it's equivalent to believing the phone number on the bathroom stall is actually going to give you a good time.", "created_utc": 1587220208.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsf0u3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnsecnl", "score": 21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnsf0u3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnsf0u3/"}
