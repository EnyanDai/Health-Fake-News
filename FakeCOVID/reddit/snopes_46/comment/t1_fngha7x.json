It's like a fundamental mentality.\n\nIt's why some people think it's reasonable to call 911 when they get the wrong fast food order despite that seeming ridiculous to most everyone. That's an extreme example, but there is a scale.\n\nSome people live in a world where everything they experience and do is regulated by forces they do not understand. Everything is transactional, zero sum. If something is unfair to them, then someone is responsible.\n\nSo I remember when I was a kid, my dad was something similar to a parole officer who spent lots of time in court. I was asking him about crimes. He told me about different punishments someone might get for stealing. \n\nI said \"But what about the stuff that got stolen?\" He said, if they find it they will give it back to the person. Or they might have insurance that will replace it. Which left me with questions. \"But what if they don't? Does the government buy them another one?\"\n\n\"No, they don't.\" he replied. \"You could sue the person, but it's expensive and they probably don't have any money.\" So that was one of the moments in my life when I realised that life is not fair. Sometimes bad things happen to you and *nobody* is responsible for remedying them.\n\nPeople live with varying degrees of those childish notions of fairness. \n\nThe current boom in the post-apocalyptic genre of fiction, zombies and all that, are a direct exploration of worlds where that veil of a safe and fair world has been completely removed.", "created_utc": 1586932199.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngha7x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngdwje", "score": 96, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngha7x", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngha7x/"}
