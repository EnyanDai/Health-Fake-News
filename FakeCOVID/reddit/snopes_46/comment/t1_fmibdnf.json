They are releasing inconclusive technology to the masses. Its literally the point I made in my first post that said would you want to put an airbag into your car that was shown to be inconclusive on test results...no you wouldnt. You would want to have definitive evidence before even taking the risk.\n\n> RF Radiation can heat you up, but will cell towers youd have to climb up and hang directly in front of the antenna for a while to feel any issues. \n\nYou have to understand these newer cell towers are 100 TIMES more powerful than the older models. So when you say you have to be directly in front of the towers, that is not the case anymore. Someone could be a good distance away and now have the same negative effect.\n\n> Where's the source on a \"weakened immune system\"?  \n\n  [https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/radiofrequency-radiation.html](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/radiofrequency-radiation.html) \n\n Taken from the article below you can see we can pinpoint exactly what it does but we know it does something, we know it does enough to potentially influence the human body.\n\n\"Most lab studies done so far have supported the idea that RF waves don't have enough energy to damage DNA directly. Because of this, it\u2019s not clear how RF radiation might be able to cause cancer.\n\nA few studies have reported evidence of biological effects that could be linked to cancer, but this is still an area of research.\n\nA study by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) exposed large groups of lab rats and mice to types of RF energy used in cell phones. The animals were exposed over their entire bodies for about 9 hours a day, starting before birth and continuing for up to 2 years. The study found an increased risk of rare heart tumors called malignant schwannomas in the male rats exposed to RF radiation, as well as possible increased risks of certain types of tumors in the brain and adrenal glands. However, there was no clear increased risk among female rats or among male or female mice in the study. The male rats also lived longer than rats who were not exposed to RF radiation, for unclear reasons. Some aspects of this study make it hard to know what these results might mean for people, **but the results add evidence to the idea that RF radiation might potentially impact human health.**\"", "created_utc": 1586106195.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmibdnf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmi3sbf", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmibdnf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmibdnf/"}
