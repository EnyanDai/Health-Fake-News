Microwaves have builtin faraday cages otherwise your food wouldn't be the only thing getting cooked. Also, infrared radiation will burn you in an instance if you get close to the source.\n\nSo you're ignoring the issue of the source and not to mention exposure time.\n\nFor example, 10 minutes of sunshine is great for you, but 10 hours and you may need an ER visit without proper protection.\n\nThe big concern with 5G RF is that in order for its tech to be a big step forward, you need a mesh network of transceivers every 500 ft or so. These would put many people CLOSE to an CONSTANT source of radiation.\n\nLike much tech and science, long term studies are not done because they are expensive and complex. No one wants to look back in 20 years and realize we made a VERY bad decision so that we could (or the gov't could) stream 4K video on our smart phones in exchange for the health of a generation.", "created_utc": 1586364967.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmt0nbp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t1_fmre87x", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmt0nbp", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmt0nbp/"}
