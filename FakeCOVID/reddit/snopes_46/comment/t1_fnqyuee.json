But what i'd be interested in is if you can cite specific studies that look into the health and safety question of whether or not 5G really is safe or not. Has 5G itself been tested or not?\n\n> Hell most grade school physical science textbooks have enough information on the basics of the electromagnetic spectrum to render this entire \"discussion\" moot. \n\nToo much theory, not enough experimental data. Where's the data on 5G itself is what I'm interested in. But I think we both know that that data doesn't exist, which is why you keep referring to theory.\n\nAnyway, don't you think it's time you had the opportunity to debate the issue live? Are you really that confident in your positon regarding 5G? Do you really believe that other scientists that hold an opposing opinion to yours are wrong? Why don't we test to see how true that is with an actual debate on youtube live via JRE?", "created_utc": 1587175260.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnqyuee", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnnomo9", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnqyuee", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnqyuee/"}
