You are correct 5G doesn't have to be at 60GHz.  Unfortunately many see the 60GHz oxygen absorption peak as a feature rather than a bug.  \"It makes for more secure data transmission\" is the selling point.\n\nI am very suspicious of the health effects as a casual student of history and it only takes a casual observer to be extremely suspicious of a new ubiquitous technology and its pollution effects.  The deliberate willful ignorance of industry forgoing proper safety testing is a giant red flag.  The fanaticism of the former FCC chairman and his push for 5G another huge red flag.  These people are not calm, rational or benevolent authorities, they are fanatic in their greed and lust for power in rolling this out.\n\nWe should not ignore the warning signs.", "created_utc": 1586393867.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmulpqd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fxaxsf", "parent_id": "t1_fmtz614", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmulpqd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fxaxsf/for_anyone_who_didnt_get_to_see_david_ickes_talk/fmulpqd/"}
