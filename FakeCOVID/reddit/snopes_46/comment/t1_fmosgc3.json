If you don't think that's true, [Here ](https://www.asbestos.com/products/talcum-powder/) is a reference for talc in baby powder containing asbestos, [here](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/fda-warns-zantac-may-have-carcinogen) is an article from a few days ago where they found Zantac causes cancer and it's been pulled.  \n\nI don't know what fantasy land you live in where companies care about people over profits, but it sounds nice... Here in Reality, Corporations worship profit over all- my point was that it wouldn't be crazy to think of a profit hungry corporation fast tracking a new tech without knowing it's 100% safe.... So if that did happen with 5G, it is believable.  My point was that if 5G did have negative health consequences, it's not like they would have found out from some 5 year test-because they probably didn't do a 5 year test.  So they wouldn't know ANY 5 year consequences.\n\nWhat is delusional in that logic?", "created_utc": 1586267518.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmosgc3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvyere", "parent_id": "t1_fmo003o", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0f", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmosgc3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/entertainment/comments/fvyere/woody_harrelson_latest_star_sharing_coronavirus/fmosgc3/"}
