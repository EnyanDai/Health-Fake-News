Again, wifi and cellphones use non-ionizing radiation. You have literally no awareness of just how minuscule the power requirements are to send signals over an extremely wide area.\n\n> Some people live feet away from the towers.\n\nUsing my example again... being 1mm away from a red hot light bulb will burn you, but being 1 meter, or yes, even 1 foot away, will result in zero harm.\n\nWhy is that? Because the red-hot filament isn't dangerous? No, it's because of **exponential distance-decay**. \n\nIs that kindergarten-grade example bullshit, or is that too much for your brain to handle?\n\nIf you truly believe the bullshit you're spouting, I expect you to never again step foot in broad daylight. If this radiation was even close to as harmful as you're implying, you would be vaporised in an instant by how strong suy rays are in comparison.\n\n> Maybe you're afraid and denying it?\n\nYeah, that must be it.
