EU members have very different geopolitical and economical situations, which translate in different goals. And as we have seen many times, the EU is made by member states with their own national interests, which sometimes happen to overlay each other. Be it Russia, where some want to work with them and others fear them. Be it Libya, where Italy and the EU support one side and France the other. Be it the refugee crisis, where some are okay with them, some hate them to death but both ignore it and let Greece and Italy mostly alone with them. Same with China. Especially now with a huge economic crisis ahead, many countries won't will be very vulnerable with Chinese takeovers, since the EU won't have conditions (i.e., unanimity) to deal with the situation. And even if those takeovers can be made by other (northern) EU members, within a union made of self interests, is probably not ideal to give more negotiating power to those members.", "created_utc": 1587557830.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo6g3py", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rr17", "parent_id": "t3_g5rr17", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo6g3py", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/g5rr17/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo6g3py/"}
