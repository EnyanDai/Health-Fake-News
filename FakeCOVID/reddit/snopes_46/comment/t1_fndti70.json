I said everything clear as day, the information for the specs on transmitters should be out there for the people KNOWLEDGEABLE enough to make an assessment on the technology be it the electrical engineer, or the guy who's dick gets hard for electronics. I'm referring specifically to people who were not on the study or paid to do the study and in turn MAKE official reports for the health effects of 5g that are released to the public. I was  simply sharing a personal story of my own  where I went from a \"primitive\" knowledge of electricity and electronics to knowing how capacitors, transistors, resisters, etc worked and how to test, remove and install them over a short period. in hopes to get through your thick head that your idea of human potential is flawed, and that you essentially saying the potential for \"everyday people\" to learn  the workings of the technology as \"impossible\"- is far more ignorant than anything I could ever say. as if only certain people are preordained to hold the brain capacity necessary for the information behind the function of 5g technology . Could you possibly link me to any of that \"complex\" 5g array components? I mean it would have to be a really bizarre technology to not fall in line with things we have seen before in many other electronics.", "created_utc": 1586877194.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fndti70", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g0rx6e", "parent_id": "t1_fndqjf4", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586878505.0, "name": "t1_fndti70", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/g0rx6e/5g_tower_fire_in_italy_during_coronavirus_lockdown/fndti70/"}
