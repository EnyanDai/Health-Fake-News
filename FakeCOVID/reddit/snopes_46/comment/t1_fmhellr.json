Here\u2019s his bio:\n\nAlfonso Balmori, biologist, consultant of the Valladolid Association of People Affected by Telephone Masts (AVAATE) in Valladolid (Spain). The Valladolid Association (AVAATE) is made up of people who suffer or have suffered from the consequences of the often illegal installation of telephone masts near their homes or work. As a collaborator of AVAATE, Balmori also gives us his view of people affected by this technology and an account of the situation of victims in Spain, what they are doing and what they can still do in the future. In his urban surroundings, Balmori has analysed the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) from telephone masts on animals.\n\nHis papers aren\u2019t peer reviewed, nor can I find similar papers by anyone other than him. He\u2019s clearly got his mind made up about the impacts, which also isn\u2019t a strong foundation for good science. \n\nThis is a great article that goes into the actual power exposure. https://www.grandmetric.com/2019/03/26/5g-health-issues-explained/\nTLDR: the headset is exposing you to way more EM than the transmitter. Makes sense right? A street lamp is more powerful because it covers a wider area. \n\nBut if your phone is far from a transmitter, it\u2019ll broadcast at max strength, trying to \u201cshine it\u2019s light\u201d all the way to a transmitter. Having more transmitters actually means /less/ power as your phone will more often have a strong signal and can dial back how \u201cbrightly\u201d it shines.\n\nOh, and remove any of those \u201cEM Blocker\u201d stickers from your phone. 1. They don\u2019t work. 2. If they did the phone would compensate for them by transmitting at a higher power and running your battery dry.", "created_utc": 1586076936.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmhellr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t1_fmhdyca", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmhellr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmhellr/"}
