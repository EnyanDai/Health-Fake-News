Billionaires gathered around a table and asked \"how to control the world\"\n2. They decided that the best way would be to connect every sentient and nonsentient being into a single network with electromagnetic waves\n3. However these waves will also be detremental to their health\n4. These waves control us, destroy our health but also gather information from us. \n\nAt this point I have to ask if the point is to control the world (1.) or destroy the world (2.)? \n\nAnd to follow up:\n\n1. Why would they want to control the world? They currently own more wealth than majority of the population combined. And they have more say in the official government now than the majority of the population. So what value would manually controlling the population give them? Other than a ton of work. And the air full of waves that are supposedly detrimental to their own health and possibly to the whole planet?\n2. Why would they want to destroy the planet.", "created_utc": 1586106405.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmibqtm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvcjl6", "parent_id": "t1_fmi7zfy", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmibqtm", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/fvcjl6/british_5g_towers_are_being_set_on_fire_amid/fmibqtm/"}
