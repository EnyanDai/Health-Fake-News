{"author": {}, "body": "> If that is case then why more than half of all foreign investments in China went into Hong Kong as opposed to mainland?\n\nWhy? Because that's exactly the purpose of Hong Kong, it's designed to be a \"gateway\" for the rest of the world to access the Chinese market. Investors prefer going through Hong Kong as the middleman because of the extra legal protections offered. It doesn't mean the money isn't still going to China. \n\n> Why are investments into India, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc on massive rise now?\n\nThere are many reasons for that. One BIG reason for those investments is that Chinese labour has become too expensive in the recent years, so they are shifting low-end manufacturing to India, Vietnam and Indonesia. \n\nTo say companies started investing in those countries solely because of the disagreement with China's totalitarianism and lack of liberal reforms is wishful thinking.", "created_utc": 1586527161.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmzq69u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fmzp47k", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmzq69u", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fmzq69u/"}
