But I'm going to assume you don't know that some Wavelegths are used as a weapon by the US military. Coincidentally they're pretty much the same Wavelegths that 5G uses (https://www.rfsafe.com/5g-network-uses-nearly-same-frequency-as-weaponized-crowd-control-systems/).\n\nThis weapon outputs that frequency at 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 Watts. 5G at it's strongest outputs about 20 Watts. Microwave radiation is a type of Thermal radiation. Another word for Thermal radiation is **heat**. Microwave radiation can cause harm, if it's outputted with sufficient energy to actually burn things. Examples of this include Microwaves and **the Sun**, which is literally bathing the Earth and you in radiation every day.\n\n> Aside from that hundreds of peer reviewed studies and the specialists in the field say otherwise.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzcA0sYQ8xtPBsXFvyBt5XEJENEtrJUcgG_4rGgrQBw/edit\n\nIt is physically impossible for non-ionizing radiation to cause damage to cells in the way the 5G Conspiritards are implying. It is not powerful enough to ionize atoms and molecules and cause the many symptoms of radiation sickness.\n\n> Above is more than 1600 studies on this very subject and this is a Scientist whose field this is making a summary of them:-\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/we-have-no-reason-to-believe-5g-is-safe/\n\nAnd here is another opinion piece by a far more qualified scientist who actually specializes in the field completely discrediting that article: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/dont-fall-prey-to-scaremongering-about-5g/\n\n> I need to ask why there are so many people like you that have no clue on this topic yet such strong opinions. Because it's actually you that is ignorant this time.\n\nYou are the ignorant one, you are claiming that this type of radiation is doing things that it can't physically do.", "created_utc": 1586152840.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkf3pj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmkb1br", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkf3pj", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmkf3pj/"}
