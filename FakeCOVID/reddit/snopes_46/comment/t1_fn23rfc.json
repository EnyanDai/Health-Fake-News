My college mate told me he that there are theories actually claiming that 5G carries the virus!\n\nWhat I showed them is a picture with the electro magnetic spectrum that showed where 5g stands in relation to other radiations such as this one\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/Tfy86qreGL5a6ESs6\n\nAnd explain to them what we call ionizing radiation, which is radiation that can remove electrons from atoms and molecules thus disrupting things which in the case of living things can have bad implications. That is why the sun can burn you or even cause cancer if you expose too much (since it carries UV radiation) and why X rays and Gamma rays can be deadly.\n\nThus as you can see 5G is in the non ionizing radiation and you should not worry about it. Now some tin foil guy will ask you the following:\n\n \"How do you know this electro magnetic spectrum is true and not what they want you to believe!\u00a1! 11!1\"\n\nIn which case you need a physics labs and a quantom physics expert to prove to him how light works.\n\nAn interesting show from a TEDx talk about why we believe thinks that are wrong (or right), which I recommend since conspiracy theories are on the rise again. For the record, yeah I can't fully explain to you why light works as both a particle and a wave but I know what I need to know to do my engineering and nerding, if I had to literally learn everything I use in school GG!\n\nEdit: some spelling", "created_utc": 1586577060.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn23rfc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyudtd", "parent_id": "t1_fn21xx5", "score": 56, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586577498.0, "name": "t1_fn23rfc", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/fyudtd/coronavirus_conspiracies_like_that_bogus_5g_claim/fn23rfc/"}
