They're having a hard time separating thermal effects (heating due to added energy) from pure electromagnetic effects, that could cause cell mutations.\n\nThis is why more testing is needed. New tech/drugs/procedures should not be presumed innocent until proven harmful. Indeed the opposite.\n\n>some people who live close to towers\n\nBecause of the nature of 5Gs short range, the towers will have to be much closer than with 4G. Think 1000 ft instead of 10 miles. [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/5g-high-speed-internet-cellular-network-issues-switch-2019-4) (there are many sources that say this)\n\n>Ie: they're concerned the across billions of people, some people who live close to towers could be more at risk of developing skin cancer or damage to their eyes.\n\nIn what world is being concerned for health effects a bad thing? \n\n\"some of you may get have health effects, but that's a chance I'm willing to take for faster mobile data\" this is how you sound.\n\nAnd yes I read both articles top to bottom. Did you? Both of them recommend future studies before widespread rollout of 5G.\n\nI didn't even say anything about cancer. Just that the regulations were based on local heating being the only effect of millimeter wave radiation and that studies have found that not to be the case.", "created_utc": 1586644738.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn4n0tk", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_fz7g4z", "parent_id": "t1_fn4la12", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_37lis", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586644942.0, "name": "t1_fn4n0tk", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/C_S_T/comments/fz7g4z/i_hate_this_stupid_5g_causes_coronavirus/fn4n0tk/"}
