I like making jokes and to really drive the borders of what is reality. I realize more and more that I can't though. I used to make nazi-jokes a few years back, because no one in my circle of acquaintances could ever, in a million years, be thinking that nazi's were fine. Since then I've met several people telling me I should really read mein kampf, and the nicest people flare up and tell me angrily that it's clear that all bad things in the world have happened due to the rich jews controlling the stupid Americans through media (I'm from Europe) into fucking shit up in the middle east and beyond.\n\nI've also met some really nice people that were smart about their surroundings (e.g. could point to any plant and say if it needed water or different nutrients and know if it was edible or not) believe that the earth was indeed probably flat.\n\n\\-------------\n\nThese experiences have made me realize I can't joke as much. People do not just nod and agree how silly something is - but nod and agree with my completely ridiculous premise as if we both agree in this insane shit.", "created_utc": 1588887909.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptaunt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt5zsz", "score": 42, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptaunt", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptaunt/"}
