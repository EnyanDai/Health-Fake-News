But how small of a fraction of a percentage of these conspiracy theories have turned out to prove there was an actual conspiracy? \n\nMost of these are based on fallacies specifically \"you can't explain x therefore I am justified in believing y\" (This is the \"argument  from ignorance\" fallacy I think).\n\nWith all conspiracies there is a little something that is needed called \"the burden of proof\".\n\nWhen you look at all the evidence around us it is clearly a communicable disease spread from person to person and has nothing to do with radio waves.  I'm sure the conspiracy theorists can come up with a bunch of \"you can't explain x therefore I'm going to believe y\" until you explain everything wrong. \n\nIt's a shame because it works counter to getting this virus under control.", "created_utc": 1586106725.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmicatd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmi3c4q", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmicatd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmicatd/"}
