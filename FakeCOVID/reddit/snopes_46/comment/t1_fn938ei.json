Those have been in many military arsenals for over a decade. They\u2019re not too secret in anyway, their effects are well documented, the science very well understood, and have been demonstrated in public. I was able to get tested by a demo unit at a security conference as part of my work (former security salesman). \n\nThey also don\u2019t get used very much because they use way too much power for their intended effect. A 5G tower rangers from 250 mW (building repeater) to 250 W (region-wide MIMO emitter). A microwave area denial weapon emits 100 kW, 400 times of even the largest 5G tower out there. These weapons are also used in short bursts, and would chew through their battery packs in minutes if left on too long.\n\nSure, anything can be used as a weapon. A garden hose can be converted into a riot water cannon with enough output, and which is much deadlier and effective than a microwave weapon. But unless we\u2019re strapping on a hydro plant to every 5G tower, it\u2019s nothing. \n\nFYI, sunlight emits 1.3 kW per square meter, 5 time harsher than a large 5G MIMO array.", "created_utc": 1586757927.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn938ei", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g02rg2", "parent_id": "t1_fn8jhbl", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh11", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn938ei", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/offbeat/comments/g02rg2/celebs_share_rumors_linking_5g_to_coronavirus/fn938ei/"}
