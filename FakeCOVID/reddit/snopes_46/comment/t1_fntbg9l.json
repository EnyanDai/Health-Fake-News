Gathering more disciples to a cult of stupidity doesn't make you any more right than when you were shouting alone on a street corner and everyone made fun of you.\n\nI don't think crap like this is about truth at all though, and that's why it's almost completely impervious to it. It's about the cult itself, and the sense of belonging and control.
