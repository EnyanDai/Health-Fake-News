I've just reached the point where trying to determine the veracity of news is so time consuming and tiring that it's easier to be sceptical and move on rather than invest the time trying to verify something.\n\nThe survey is correct for the survey. I'm impressed the article actually linked to the survey, most of the time they don't.\n\nSurvey companies are also going to self-guide themselves towards people who are willing to answer surveys which means I don't trust their theory and I don't trust surveys generally, because a lot of the time they're choose from set options or intentionally loaded questions for time/processing reasons rather than ask an open ended question and spend a lot of time sorting out genuinely unbiased responses.\n\nFinally, the people who do answer surveys will behave differently just because they're being measured in some way simply because someone is interested in their knowledge and/or opinions and will make stuff up to sound informed rather than truthfully convey ignorance on a matter. It's simply part of human behaviour.\n\nPlus, as you outlined above: Incentives are offered to participants. Some of them are just answering questions to get a free something.\n\nBut they're creating and cherry-picking the survey to get results for sensationalist headlines.\n\nThere's also the equivalent of the 'file drawer problem', where they do the survey and don't find results that are newsworthy because they don't create a particular compelling headline to generate an emotional response, and therefore there's no article to represent the non-finding.\n\nAll that being said, maybe its still the best understanding we can generate at a reasonable cost. I appreciate they're trying to remove bias and all that.\n\nNone of it really helps that much. It's basically \"a bunch of non-experts don't know much about the thing they don't know about\".\n\nUnfortunately this is also why marketing departments are so large.\n\nThe real truth is ZDNet have produced an article to induce reactionary comments on the internet and show advertising.\n\nWell done ZDNet, you win.", "created_utc": 1589901255.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr52cd8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr4vu9l", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr52cd8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr52cd8/"}
