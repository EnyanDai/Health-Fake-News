As it is known that [cell phones affect brain waves.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mind-control-by-cell/), and [blue light affects us in different ways](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side), we can't just assume 5g, an essentially open standard, is completely safe. Regarding your cancer comment, that is strange. Lab rats develop cancer, if they live to an old age. For our cancer rates to drop, it would mean we are dying sooner than cancer can kill us. Truth, our life expectancy has declined for the past few years. But to say there is no connection between cell phones and cancer is too big a step:\n\nFrom 2019:\n\n>[Regarding the safety of 5G, it should be noted that like earlier technologies (3G and 4G), a threshold level for detrimental effects is expected. Major shortcomings of the reports claiming no link between exposure to RF-EMF and brain cancer have been already addressed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6820018/)\n\nThey were addressed by this study:\n\n>[However, substantial evidence now indicates that RF-EMFs increase the reactive oxygen species production and DNA damages which play an important role in the initiation and progression of cancer. Currently, there is no widely accepted answer to this question whether there is a relationship between exposure to RF-EMFs from cell phones and cancer incidence and mortality.](www.journalrcr.org/article.asp?issn=2588-9273;year=2017;volume=8;issue=4;spage=165;epage=167;aulast=Mortazavi)\n\n\nmmWave is known to penetrate the skin, as evidenced by many studies, such as:\n\n> [...analyses of penetration depth show that more than 90% of the transmitted  power  is  absorbed  in the epidermis  and  dermis layer...](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1503/1503.05944.pdf) \n\nHowever, even studies that [showed no affect after 24 hours, were **only for 24 hours**.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4997488/) \n\nIf something penetrates the skin, it will have an effect.\n\n>As 5G uses exactly the same frequencies at powers that are, at worst, equivalent to what we already have, there is no logical reason why it would be any different\n\n4g uses 700 to 2.7ghz, but Verizon has two spectrums for 5g, 28ghz and 39ghz, while Riyadh experimented with 60ghz(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7510953?denied=), and China is open [up to 86 GHz](https://www.gsma.com/spectrum/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mmWave-5G-Benefits-China-English.pdf)\n\nFun fact: Microwave ovens operate at 2.45ghz\n\nAlso, it's late, but have you heard any updates to 2018 study by John Bucher?\n\n>[\u201cThe exposures used in the studies cannot be compared directly to the exposure that humans experience when using a cell phone,\u201d said John Bucher, Ph.D., NTP senior scientist. \u201cIn our studies, rats and mice received radio frequency radiation across their whole bodies. By contrast, people are mostly exposed in specific local tissues close to where they hold the phone. In addition, the exposure levels and durations in our studies were greater than what people experience.\u201d The lowest exposure level used in the studies was equal to the maximum local tissue exposure currently allowed for cell phone users. This power level rarely occurs with typical cell phone use. The highest exposure level in the studies was four times higher than the maximum power level permitted.](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/newsroom/releases/2018/november1/index.cfm)\n\nI'll read your response tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1587263977.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnuk2in", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnu8748", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnuk2in", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnuk2in/"}
