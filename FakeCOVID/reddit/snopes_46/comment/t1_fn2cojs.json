I know one person, and I'm still trying to get him to answer this question: \"It's very easy to put cells in a petri dish, expose them to 5G frequencies, and monitor them for the generation of viruses. Why don't we see the Corona virus being generated in these cases?\" Has anyone received a solid answer to that question from such a believer?\n\nIt seems this conspiracy is(perhaps even primarily) being spread through YouTube. There are people with quite large yet homogeneous followings, promoting this one. Resulting in videos with millions of views and 95%+ like ratios. That in turn creates appeals to popularity within an information bias. The high like ratio is not from the accuracy of the claims therein, but because the individual has an existing following that has been primed to apply little to no critical thinking to their claims. The fear of 5G has also been around for a while, and fits an existing narrative.", "created_utc": 1586584500.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn2cojs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyudtd", "parent_id": "t3_fyudtd", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn2cojs", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/fyudtd/coronavirus_conspiracies_like_that_bogus_5g_claim/fn2cojs/"}
