A 5g tower would use about 120W max, and power dropoff is huge for cell towers, so by the time it got to you even from 30 meters away it would be 1000x less than what they're using in the studies.\n\nhttps://www.grandmetric.com/2019/03/26/5g-health-issues-explained/\n\nSo basically, if you found a 5g mast, went directly up to it, and held your head against it for an hour, you might experience some mild dizziness/nausea that would pass after a short time. There is no chance that you would suffer any lasting ill effects, or any effects at all under normal conditions\n\nYour television and microwave hit you with more radiation tham 5G would.", "created_utc": 1587224658.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsmjcd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnsin41", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnsmjcd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnsmjcd/"}
