A fair number for the point at which it becomes ionising is about 120nm, which is extreme UV. So most, but not all, UV is non-ionising, and especially the UV you're likely to encounter in normal life. And some radiation that isn't ionising can cause biochemical effects (which is how plants work, so it's just as well or we'd all still be caked onto a deep sea vent right now). \n\nNormal UV starts at 750THz, not 750GHz. And yes, 60GHz is solidly among the \"not hazardous\" bands.\n\nOf course you can still do yourself a mischief with very high field strengths, just as 50Hz will also fuck you up at sufficient field strengths and the lightning bolt you get by touching the high tension wires will happily ionise air and bits of you too, just not by radiation.\n\nMost \"research\" seems to be claiming some kind of biological effect of the radiation other than ionisation and heating, probably because those arguments are debunked fairly well now.\n\nAn effect on biology isn't unthinkable (perhaps by affecting proteins or certain cellular structures at specific frequencies), but there's not much in the way of evidence in actual research (as opposed to Facebook manifestos), especially at 5G signal strengths.", "created_utc": 1586887096.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnecvir", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g13hvm", "parent_id": "t1_fne90c5", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586887296.0, "name": "t1_fnecvir", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/g13hvm/britains_itv_under_fire_over_presenters/fnecvir/"}
