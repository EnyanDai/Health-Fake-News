Why don't you actually get a basic degree in engineering or something? You could actually make some money, you seem interested, but maybe a bit frustrated? Like, what do you gain by calling people dumb? Forgive me, I looked at your profile and thought it was interesting. Have you thought of getting accredited in anything? It'll help your confidence\n\nYou can call yourself any username on reddit and have a masters of civil engineering. But apparently you can have a masters of civil engineering and be too dumb to vote, according to you \ud83d\ude02 me and my dumb username. Get some credentials pal, you'll help yourself immensely $$$ probably won't be so angsty either.
