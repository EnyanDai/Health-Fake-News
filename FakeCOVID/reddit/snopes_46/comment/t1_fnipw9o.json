The root of it seems to be a few peer reviewed papers that say mmWave 5G (the high frequency part) hasn't been tested well enough. Which has some weight to it.\n\nThe problem is that the UK and EU aren't implementing mmWave just yet for exactly this reason. The US is plowing ahead as usual though. We're only implementing the mid frequency part to give more bandwidth for 5G phones and soon the low frequency part to add coverage over a larger area. mmWave spectrum has been reserved but not sold yet.\n\nAll the frequencies are reused, but the high ones were not used on a large scale by the MoD.\n\nAll of this is what I have found so far and may not be 100% accurate and certainly not complete. However I find it fascinating (and scary) to try to find what starts these types of movements.", "created_utc": 1586984270.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnipw9o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1ud0b", "parent_id": "t1_fnhz8g0", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnipw9o", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/g1ud0b/vandals_set_50_cellphone_masts_in_the_uk_on_fire/fnipw9o/"}
