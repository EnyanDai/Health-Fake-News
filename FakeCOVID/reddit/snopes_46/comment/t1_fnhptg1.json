The typical Wi-Fi router operates on an extra 5G band frequency; so we're already exposed to a minor amount of the frequency as-is.\n\nBut the effect isn't quite the same with a massive transmission tower. We're talking about an absolutely massive 5G transmission tower that has to pump out extremely far-reaching short wave frequencies 24 hours a day.\n\nIf you have the source to prove that there is virtually 0% chance of harm being done by that, please share. I am *trying* to get the point across that it's most likely safe, but most of you are just attacking me for addressing the point that there's not a consensus on the safety of the technology in the first place. Which is childish.\n\nScience is about concrete evidence. It's a hypothesis, a series of experiments, and a conclusion. If you don't have any of those and just automatically declare your point of view correct; you're not a scientist, you're a skeptic.", "created_utc": 1586966750.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnhptg1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnh2fr2", "score": -3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnhptg1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnhptg1/"}
