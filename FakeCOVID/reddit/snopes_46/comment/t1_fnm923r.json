But the wavelength of 5G is still huge, way beyond visible light and even infared, it's a very low energy radiation.\n\nThe only risk would be if a molecule in the human body (in particular DNA) have a resonant frequency that matches those used in 5G. Even then, because the radiation is of the order of mW this seems incredibly doubtful, and I'm not sure if it would be a problem even in that far fetched hypothetical notion. I can't say, but I'm confident it won't, hence the 5g router in my room.\n\nThere are genuine questions to ask about technology, and it's certainly the right spirit to question every breakthrough with; is this safe? Many disasters could have been sidestepped if people were more cautious, car exhaust fumes being the prime candidate, they've probably killed of the order of hundreds of millions.\n\nSo I get the core spirit, to question 5g. By all means. But read a damned book, or a paper. When people act in ignorance and violently it's utterly unacceptable, and they should be dealt with like petty criminals in my opinion.", "created_utc": 1587067208.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnm923r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnm54ce", "score": 28, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnm923r", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnm923r/"}
