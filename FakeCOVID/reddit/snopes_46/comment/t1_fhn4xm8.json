It is in essence a loan, here it's the same, you can call it all you want but it is just a loan; a owed debt that will be collected even when you die. For that reason, we call it for what it is; a loan,.\n\nMostly used by poor people who ya know gotta have the newest phone for some reason. You should not have to save longer than 1 maybe 2 months for a phone, that's a rule of thumb here. And it works our people have much less debt and are much less likely to go into debt.\n\nSince it's a loan, it will be registered as one since 2018, you cannot loan for your house if you have ANY debt, so your 2 year plan is in essence a debt that you first need to pay off, additionally it will be registered that you don't know how to handle money, and banks may deny you other loans in the near future of 5 years -- if you cannot prove you finally can handle money. And I agree, if you can't pay a phone straight than why the hell do you think you can handle a mortgage, it's small numbers. You wouldn't loan for a car right, why for a phone?\n\nAlso the maximum you can loan for a phone is depended on your income. So people who make less than 2500eur a month cannot loan more than 20eur per month for their phone. And why would they need it, I make less and have no need for such loans.\n\nIn the end we came to the conclusion that buying phones with plans aka loaning money, is just really dumb and not needed at all (here), not even for the \"poor\", we don't really have much poverty here. Just set your standards lower or if you must save for it all year to get your 1349eur Samsung S20.\n\nI pay 10eur per month for my 4G 12GB data and unlimited text. I pay 0 per month for my phone cause I paid it cash, been doing that since forever.", "created_utc": 1581721977.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fhn4xm8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_f38jqa", "parent_id": "t1_fhmsfjy", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1f", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1581722500.0, "name": "t1_fhn4xm8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/f38jqa/digitimes_coronavirus_production_delays_will_not/fhn4xm8/"}
