Before the printing press, copies of books and documents were handwritten and as a result, quite rare. Then along comes the printing press and like the internet it changes everything.\n\nAt first it's mainly used for good - the spreading of ideas, literature art and music and theology. It also allows news to spread, which tended to be only for the nobility up to that point. It takes the words in the bible out of the control of the church, spreading bibles not written in Latin. The pope even threatened to excommunicate anyone caught printing church writings without permission. Also it's unlikely that Luther would have been able to spread his ideas without it.\n\nThen all that information flying around starts pissing off those in power and then we started to see a surge in misinformation/propoganda. Shit got really weird in Europe and upset a lot of apple carts, toppling kings and starting wars (in the internet version of this, we are here).\n\nThe internet is rewriting our social fabric, just as the printing press before it did. Not all of it is fun to live through, especially once the rich and powerful start getting bloody noses from it (Snowden, Panama papers).", "created_utc": 1586933301.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngihxo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fng0735", "score": 43, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586937101.0, "name": "t1_fngihxo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngihxo/"}
