We know very well the effects photons of these frequencies have on living things, slightly fucks up bird navigation...and if birds nest on transmitters the eggs never hatch as the eggs remain too warm.  Effects oh humans are nil, except perhaps being within a couple yards of an active transmitter might warm you a couple of degrees, these frequencies are even less penetrating to human skin and tissues than all prior wireless comms.\n\nDo they somehow thing the data encapsulation technique is going to somehow alter the physical properties of the light?  That\u2019s what this is after all, low energy light, like infrared but a bit less energy.\n\nRead your article, it\u2019s complete bullshit and contains some pretty crazy claims and nearly every cited \u201cfact\u201d is demonstrably wrong.\n\nHere\u2019s a fun quote:\n\u201cVirtually everything we own and buy, from refrigerators and washing machines to milk cartons, hairbrushes and infants\u2019 diapers, will contain antennas and microchips and will be connected wirelessly to the Internet. Every person on Earth will have instant access to super-high-speed, low- latency wireless communications from any point on the planet, even in rainforests, mid-ocean and the Antarctic.\u201d", "created_utc": 1586150538.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkcie9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t1_fmg0iau", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586150907.0, "name": "t1_fmkcie9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmkcie9/"}
