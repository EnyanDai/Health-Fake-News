If people in non-shit countries worked those manufacturing jobs for less-shit pay, yes things would be more expensive but those people would also have productive jobs.\n\nMaybe it's just me who doesn't need as much stuff, but I'd be happier with half as much with trade restricted based on labour laws, etc.  Why do we fight so hard for min wage here and then shrug when our shit is all made by people making a fraction, under totalitarian governments?", "created_utc": 1586560427.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn1encm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fn1cavr", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn1encm", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fn1encm/"}
