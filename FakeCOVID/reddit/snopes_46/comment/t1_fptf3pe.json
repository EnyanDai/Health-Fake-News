She use to be a university professor and now is retired.  About a year ago we were at a party and she came up to me with perhaps the best ice breaker I've ever heard: \"So, what do you think of vaccines?\"\n\nI thought this was an innocent question, perhaps related to a recent news study or something that she was going to tell me about (she knows I like science stuff).  So I answer with, \"They are great!\"\n\nThe next 20 minutes was me debating with her the usefulness of vaccines and with my limited knowledge trying to tell her how herd immunity is why her son (which she never vaccinated) never got sick, and how the government isn't trying to control everything you do (this is Canada, so the statement is even more hilarious).\n\nAbout a month ago I get an email from her asking me if I know how to download youtube videos and a link to a woman talking about how 5G is responsible for covid-19.\n\nThis was a woman who I thought had critical thinking skills.  Is it because she is getting older?  Is it because she is looking for belonging (to a belief/group) in her life?  Is it because of aliens?", "created_utc": 1588890096.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptf3pe", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpsr74a", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptf3pe", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptf3pe/"}
