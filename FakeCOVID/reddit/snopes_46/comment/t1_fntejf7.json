People are idiots - but nobody is going to go out and commit arson unless they have something to legitimately be afraid of, or a cause they believe in. These attacks on 5G infrastructure have been going on since December - look it up. Its a totally different movement - the only correlation has been applied by Murdoch and co. to try and discredit and make fun of people who are opposing the installation of these towers.\n\nIn reality, everyone here thinking they\u2019re the world authority on RF radiation doesn\u2019t have a fucking notion. For anyone moronic enough to think that we can have this technology with no biological trade off whatsoever, read this paper by researchers at the University of Toronto :\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00223/full\n\nI\u2019m a stem cell researcher and I\u2019ve used simple 3G RF frequencies on cell lines and they have a profound effect on signaling in glial cells specifically. Obviously things can be different on an organismal level, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind. Personally, I have my reservations and I would encourage Govs to carry out testing before allowing such high frequency RF EMR to be commonplace. We don\u2019t want this to be another Teflon situation. That being said that isn\u2019t even close to my main concern...\n\nAnd for those idiots thinking this is simply going to be faster internet on your phones, please don\u2019t be so naive. Why are corporations and governments pushing so hard to get these installed? It\u2019s the internet of things. All devices in constant communication. It\u2019s going to completely eradicate the scarce privacy we have left. From your phone, your TV, your car, traffic lights, medical data. Real time tracking of trucks, cars and people. AI-automated drones and closed circuit TV all gathering information and data. All gathered and complied in real time. As AI gets better, we\u2019re going to see what happens with advertising online become far more applicable to different parts of our life. \n\nBig data on everyone.", "created_utc": 1587240061.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fntejf7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntdbqh", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587241081.0, "name": "t1_fntejf7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fntejf7/"}
