It was the Church who established Europe's first universities during the middle ages.\n\nToday it is corporations and governments that are the ruling power and they fund their own 'scientists' to push their agendas. The tobacco companies funded many 'scientific' studies to prove that smoking was not harmful to your health, just as today pharmaceutical companies do the same to prove that their prescription drugs and vaccines are safe.\n\nThere are always real scientists like Gallileo on the other side who are making claims based on truth without being motivated by agenda or by money but they are always in the minority and always ridiculed in the beginning.", "created_utc": 1586667111.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn5k7b2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyszf4", "parent_id": "t1_fn3yito", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn5k7b2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fyszf4/5g_is_not_linked_to_the_coronavirus_pandemic_in/fn5k7b2/"}
