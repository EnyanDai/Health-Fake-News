The FCC had to clear those frequencies for use in 5g causing Intelsat stocks to plummet in the US. The higher 5g frequency wavelengths will not travel as far due to RF propagation principles so the solution is more base stations at lower powers.  These are going to be small boxes on the side of buildings, on telephone poles.  Not the giant masts people are burning that operate 4g and older technologies (as mentioned in the article that the masts being burned are not 5g)  \n\nAlso if you think microwave ovens are \"sealed off\" try to use wifi by it.  Please set your microwave oven and router on fire if you think this is a conspiracy. \n\nI am an RF engineer and no government has paid me to lie to you, I promise.\n \nEdit: typos, I'm on mobile. Also bandwidth doesn't mean what you think it means, 5g has higher bandwidths than previous cell technologies.", "created_utc": 1587066394.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnm7eun", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnm6dk1", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587066592.0, "name": "t1_fnm7eun", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnm7eun/"}
