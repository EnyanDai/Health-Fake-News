I saw it was from a established journal and figured that meant it was peer reviewed and that was enough for me. I definitely need to pay more attention to that sort of thing. \n\nThe street light analogy makes a lot of sense, but It still might not be totally accurate because 5g isn\u2019t just about your phone, but the internet of things and connection every device to each other. So instead of one phone shining really bright, you have 20-30 devices shining a little bit. Like stage lights, individual they aren\u2019t all that bright but together the are blinding. \n\nAnd I dont have an em blocker.

But 5g seems like a big change and I think it would be great ensure it\u2019s safety through experiments rather than theory.
