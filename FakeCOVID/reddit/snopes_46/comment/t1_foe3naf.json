This is obviously wrong as many mass bird deaths haven\u2019t been close to 5G and couldn\u2019t be connected to it. Also mass bird deaths aren\u2019t uncommon so this theory isn\u2019t very strong.\n\nThe next one is that 5G damages trees. I don\u2019t really understand this one as it makes no sense. The only point I could find about this is that the government are cutting down trees close to 5G towers to cover up this fact. So no point on listening to this there\u2019s no evidence it harms trees.\n\nMany people believe this mainly due to social media, many anti vaccination groups are also trying to convince people that 5G is harmful.\nThese conspiracies have been going on for years, unfortunately the pandemic has increased this idea that 5G is harmful.", "created_utc": 1587695373.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "foe3naf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g6vp2j", "parent_id": "t1_foe08uv", "score": 66, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi1r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_foe3naf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/meme/comments/g6vp2j/if_you_think_5g_towers_caused_coronavirus_your/foe3naf/"}
