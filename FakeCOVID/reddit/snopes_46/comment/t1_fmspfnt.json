It highly depends on where you are, and how many satellites you can get signals from. But it's possible to get 1-2mm with a single receiver, and even better with a measurement network.\n\nIf you wanna talk sources, I'd be super interested in seeing a source about 5G being used for 3D imaging. It's possible to use any radio frequency for 3D imaging, but doing so from a cell tower would be a new breakthrough. Typically, something like ground penetrating radar (ie, using radio waves to penetrate a surface and produce an image), is typically only accurate for up to 30m or so. \n\nAlso, no need to wait for Elon Musk's skyline. Satellite observation is nothing new. Theres already many remote sensing satellites equipped with long range lidar, such as [Landsat 8](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat_8). Satellites like that can do things like [image the forest floor below the canopy](https://gisgeography.com/lidar-light-detection-and-ranging/). Landsat 8 goes around the earth once every 98.8 minutes, and can fully image the entire earth on its own in [16 days](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-8?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con). That's just one satellite. There are many many earth imaging satellites put up by the US alone, with varying sensors and levels of resolution", "created_utc": 1586359858.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmspfnt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t1_fms6dsf", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmspfnt", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmspfnt/"}
