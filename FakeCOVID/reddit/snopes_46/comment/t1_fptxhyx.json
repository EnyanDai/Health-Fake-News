So because of the higher amount of towers it will be easier/faster to accurately triangulate your position but I doubt it\u2019s a significant difference. \n\nWith 4g governments and apps can see what building you\u2019re in already. With 5g they could probably tell what room you\u2019re in. That being said the U1 chip in the new iPhones is even more accurate than any 5g would be. There are benefits like being able to pull up a map in a mall and it show you exactly where you are. But the U1 chip along with someone hacking your phone\u2019s camera for photogrammetry and the hacker can know exactly what room you are in currently, what it looks like in a 3d model, and where you are in it.\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2019/9/10/20859550/apple-iphone-11-pro-airdrop-u1-locator-chip-tag-tile-bluetooth-tracking\n\nWhat I think is a much more likely thing to be worried about instead of hackers is what companies that we voluntarily give this information over to do with it. Imagine how much more Google can profit off of you knowing exactly where you walked all throughout the day. Knowing each and every store in the mall you walked through and for how long. Whether you went to the frozen pizza aisle in your grocery store that day. And what car you took for a test drive at the car dealership. Then again they already know most of this information about me anyways because I have a gmail account.", "created_utc": 1588900252.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptxhyx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptmsz9", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptxhyx", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptxhyx/"}
