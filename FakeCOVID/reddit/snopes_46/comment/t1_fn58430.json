Well, that\u2019s not the only reason, there are many more. But ever since Trump entered politics officially, his followers have ruined conspiracy research and make us all seem like dumb, racist, redneck sociopaths by association. T_D rejects and the Q Continuum have been kicked out of their holes and infested other conspiracy spaces online. And they propagate their low key racist, classist, and all around insane liberal conspiracies on mainstream sites enough to make the news and discredit any legitimate research. They have poisoned the well, not even realizing that they are the disinfo agents. They are the \u201cRussian bots\u201d muddying the waters and making everything a partisan conspiracy. They have lost sight of the forest for the trees.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there have been plenty of racists and dumbasses muddying the waters in conspiracy research for a while, but now the fucking President is repeating these asinine conspiracies on TV and Twitter like there is any truth to this nonsense. And now actual research is being dismissed because Trump repeats Facebook and Twitter memes with no fact checking. It has made me walk away the community because I\u2019m tired of wasting half my time arguing about irrelevant and fake information.\n\nThat may be a little harsh, but it\u2019s not wrong.", "created_utc": 1586658212.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn58430", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fz7g4z", "parent_id": "t3_fz7g4z", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_37lis", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586659752.0, "name": "t1_fn58430", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/C_S_T/comments/fz7g4z/i_hate_this_stupid_5g_causes_coronavirus/fn58430/"}
