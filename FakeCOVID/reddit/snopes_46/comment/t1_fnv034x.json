But this study merely pointed out that EMF causes oxidative stress along with countless other sources we interact with such as food, alcohol, beverages, stress, medicines, ultraviolet light etc. Still further studies are needed to prove that this leads to an incidence of illness. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I did not see how EMF compares to the other oxidative stress causers. Obviously we know that prolonged UV (a higher-frequency EMF) exposure can and often leads to DNA damage and abnormal growth. We also know that alcohol and tobacco are proven carcinogens. Low-frequency EMF is not a proven carcinogen however. As I asked before, as you believe this is dangerous, how have you adjusted your life and behavior regarding low-frequency EMF? I mean you\u2019re currently interacting with an emitter of said radiation. \n\nIn my opinion\u2014and it is only that\u2014the biggest concern to safety and well-being with 5G and other technologies is how it is used by others. I am more concerned of the invasions of privacy, the ability for mass surveillance, and data harvesting that these stronger and more pervasive networks create then its hypothesized health concerns.", "created_utc": 1587275969.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnv034x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnuxk5b", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnv034x", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnv034x/"}
