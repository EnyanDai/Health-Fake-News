The Qing government didn't view the Opium War as a \"rebellion\", it viewed it as a bunch of barbarians on the periphery making trouble, as barbarians on the periphery do -- equivalent to nomadic Mongols raiding the border.  There were actual rebellions in the west Beijing prioritized.\n\n(Frankly, I'm not convinced the Qing government was really wrong.  Major causes of Qing incapacity are (1) monetary/taxation policy, (2) racist Manchu/Han caste system and system necessary to uphold it.  If Mexican silver mine disruptions in early 19th century cause you problems as an empire that doesn't trade that much, you need to change your tax systems.\n\nEuropeans didn't get really dangerous versus the great land empires of the world until the late 19th century. India was a special case, because of anarchy from collapse of Mughal Empire.)", "created_utc": 1587578621.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo7hwx5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rr17", "parent_id": "t1_fo69nwj", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587578853.0, "name": "t1_fo7hwx5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/g5rr17/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo7hwx5/"}
