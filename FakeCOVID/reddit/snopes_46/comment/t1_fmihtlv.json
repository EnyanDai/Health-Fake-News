Two things occurring together or in proximity are not necessarily causally related.  If I eat an ice cream cone and then misstep off a curb and sprain my ankle, it does not mean the ice cream caused my injury.  The correlation is coincidental.  Unfortunately, though, these stupid conspiracies take on a life of their own when released into an ignorant and receptive group of people.  One would have thought in the 21st century that people would have outgrown these baseless hysterias caused by lies and misinformation in uncritical minds.
