No, of course not. The information should be available regardless who who decides to read it. \n\nDidn't say that. Just said it doesn't matter as most people don't read them. \n\n>So your solution is to just suppress the information and not release it then? I really dont understand your argument here. Its like you are arguing for ignorance and not disseminating information.\n\nDidn't say that either. \n\nYour whole argument was how it's the responsibility of scientists to let the public know 5G is safe. My point is even if they held nightly press conferences it won't matter. A majority of people wouldn't listen or care. So instead of wasting time trying to educate the public, the public should take time to educate themselves. But that's not going to happen either. So maybe the only solution is to guard the 5G towers.
