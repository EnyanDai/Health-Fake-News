It shouldn't take much to understand which person's viewpoint should carry more weight, but a huge number of people can't seem to do this and take both views as of equal importance.\n\nIt's not that balance is a bad thing, it's just that many people are too dumb or intellectually lazy to consider validity in a debate. Until people can do this maybe we should do away with the concept of balance in mass media, at least for certain topics.", "created_utc": 1585995663.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fme9xpe", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fu4x2o", "parent_id": "t1_fmaszat", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fme9xpe", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fu4x2o/uk_media_outlets_told_not_to_promote_baseless_5g/fme9xpe/"}
