Are you okay with an end to consumerism as we know it?  Because while you might be, our economy and our consumers are not.  The problem is that we race to to the bottom on all things, are sticklers to just in time production, etc.  This is a problem of neoliberal capitalism.", "created_utc": 1586559063.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn1cavr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fn19vge", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn1cavr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fn1cavr/"}
