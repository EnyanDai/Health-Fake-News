What you believe is still a choice you make on your own.  [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conspiracy\\_theory](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory) \n\n## Defence of conspiracy theories[[edit](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Conspiracy_theory&action=edit&section=17)]\n\nWhile conspiracy theories often show scant regard for evidence or plausibility, and may incorporate racist or other unacceptable mindsets, there is a minority current of opinion that says the label \"conspiracy theory\" is used by those in power to stifle legitimate criticism and to smear opponents. Anthropologist Erica Lagalisse has suggested that the label, together with the stereotype of the conspiracy theorist as an [uneducated basement dweller](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_cellarium), manifests a form of class discrimination with privileged wealthy elites attacking poor (and hence basement-dwelling) people whose conspiracy theories typically represent in a confused way the real forces controlling their lives. Lagalisse has suggested that automatically condemning and mocking those who come up with conspiracy theories is an example of how those in positions of power systematically marginalize and delegitimize criticism from outside the establishment.[\\[35\\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#cite_note-lagalisse-39)\n\nIt has also been credibly suggested that the [CIA](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/CIA) promoted the concept of the paranoid conspiracy theory mindset to discredit genuine criticisms of real conspiratorial behavior by the US government. Political scientist Lance deHaven-Smith uncovered information that in the 1960s with a growing suspicion of the government's involvement in the John F Kennedy assassination and other events, CIA field offices were tasked with a public relations campaign to ridicule critics as irrational conspiracy theorists, promoting the impression that anyone suggesting secret government conspiracies was crazy. deHaven-Smith has argued that the appropriate response to conspiracy theories is not to crack down on them or decry the thought processes that seek hidden explanations, but to ensure that suspicious events are investigated in a transparent, independent, and objective way.[\\[36\\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#cite_note-alternetconspiracy-40)[\\[37\\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#cite_note-41)[\\[38\\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#cite_note-42)\n\nFurther evidence for an attempt to stigmatise conspiracy theorists can be seen in the contrasting fortunes of [Charles A. Beard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Beard)\ud83d\udcf7, a once-hugely influential historian who sought to explain American history through economic self-interest of elites but who fell out of favor in the [Cold War](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cold_War), and one of his chief critics, [Richard Hofstadter](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Richard_Hofstadter) who popularised an attack on the \"paranoid style\" of conspiracy theorising and became one of the most prominent public intellectuals in the 1960s.[\\[36\\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#cite_note-alternetconspiracy-40)[\\[39\\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#cite_note-43) What name could be more perfect for a crazy conspiracy theorist than Beard, unless it was Neck-Beard?", "created_utc": 1586103275.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmi68yr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t3_fvf99x", "score": -5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmi68yr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmi68yr/"}
