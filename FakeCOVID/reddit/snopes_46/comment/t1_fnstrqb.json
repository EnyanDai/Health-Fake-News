If I throw a pen at my tv, the tv will be affected by my pen. Without further specification it could mean anything between a huge crack and a cleanable ink spot. In the case of the study, it mentions that none of the effects are of serious health concerns. \n\nAlso, 5G will NOT cook your skin. Here\u2019s why: \nElectromagnetic waves with the same frequency as 5G CAN technically cook your skin since microwave ovens basically use em waves similar frequencies. The difference is that microwave ovens have a power of about 800 Watt or higher. 5G towers emit at ~ 2 Watt, which your body will hardly notice. Besides, electromagnetic waves of those frequencies carry very little energy. Higher frequency = more energy = relatively more dangerous per unit of power, and 1 - 100 GHz is not a lot. For comparison, visible light, the electromagnetic waves that our bodies are being blasted with every second and which we use to see, ranges from 400 to 800 THz (which is a magnitude of 1000 to 100,000 higher). And that\u2019s literally a light bulb we\u2019re talking about, which often has a power of 60-100W, or 18W if you\u2019re using a LED. Trust me, 2W of 100GHz light definitely will not slowly cook you. It will hardly get past a few millimeters through your skin. \n\nSource: I\u2019m an university level astrophysics student", "created_utc": 1587228640.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnstrqb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnsptg2", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587231849.0, "name": "t1_fnstrqb", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnstrqb/"}
