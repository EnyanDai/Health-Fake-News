It is heating it, but due to lack of power the water is dissipating the heat faster than its being heated. BUT the water is still oscillating faster than natural rests. My theory is that this is happening to oxygen as well and due to the spin it is not binding to hemoglobin. It wouldn\u2019t matter how hot the air is, the molecules are still oscillating faster than natural rest. \n\nThe studies I\u2019ve linked have shown known changes to biological structures exposed to low/high power MM WL over periods of time. \n\nI can understand your skepticism on how it relates to the virus, but hey this a conspiracy sub.
