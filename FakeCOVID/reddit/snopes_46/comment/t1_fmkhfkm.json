If you will see 6ghz 5g in your area, you will have a tower every few city blocks or depending on landscape and buildings, far denser than that even.  This is one of the facts the conspiracy theorists latch on to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not super knowledgeable in it, but I just know that the lower the frequency the farther you get reliable communication using less power (especially digital), and the deeper it can penetrate.\n\nI just know because I used to build industrial devices with some pre-built 350mhz modules that punched through steel reinforced concrete from a base station half a mile away.  Just outdoors and we could talk for legitimately several miles.  I think the radios were tuned to use something like 4 watts to xmit, but I am not entirely sure it's been 15 years.  I was working from home then and I built a test set and had my wife watch an LED light at home while I drove away in my car to test the range though.", "created_utc": 1586155059.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkhfkm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmi60ek", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586155412.0, "name": "t1_fmkhfkm", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmkhfkm/"}
