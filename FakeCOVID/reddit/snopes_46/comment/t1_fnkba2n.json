Having first gained momentum online in early January, the 5G conspiracy theory \u2014 which alleges, among other things, that Covid-19 has either been caused by the frequencies used for the new wireless technology, or that those signals impair the human immune system \u2014 has spilled rapidly into the offline world.\n> \n> In the UK, where the attacks began, almost 60 masts have been set ablaze to date, while this week two towers were vandalised in Co Donegal in Ireland, and another in Limassol in Cyprus was attacked by 18 people. In the Netherlands, there have so far been 11 recorded attempts \u2014 one of which was accompanied by a scrawled piece of graffiti that read \u201cFuck 5G\u201d.\n> \n> The improbable escalation of the theory \u2014 which in the UK has even begun to gain some traction in the mainstream television media \u2014 has alarmed European authorities, who are racing to track down the perpetrators of the mast fires and prevent further attacks. Meanwhile it has also raised questions over the origins of the conspiracy and the source of its momentum.\n> \n> \u201cIt is a very dangerous situation,\u201d said Rob Bongenaar, a director of Dutch telecoms industry body Monet. \u201cThese people are attacking vital infrastructure.\u201d\n> \n> Theories linking telecoms networks to health issues such as cancer and infertility have existed since the 3G era \u2014 though few expected they would ever gain mainstream attention.\n> \n> According to Hanna Linderst\u00e5l, chief executive of the Swedish data company Earhart Business Protection Agency, which tracks online disinformation, the first video directly linking coronavirus to 5G appeared online in early January in the form of a lecture that discussed the influence of electromagnetic radiation on pandemics. \u201cIt was really scary to look at,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start thinking \u2014 should I move to the countryside?\u201d\n> \n> Soon dozens of videos started appearing showing dead birds, dead fish and people fainting in the street \u2014 all, according to the videos, the result of 5G. Ms Linderst\u00e5l tracked 35 of the most popular videos that appeared in January and found that, within weeks, they\u2019d been viewed 12.8m times.\n> \n> Since then, the theory has rapidly gained traction in the offline world. In the UK this week, the head of Vodafone UK issued a statement arguing that lives were being endangered by a \u201cdangerous lie\u201d around 5G, after a mast near Birmingham\u2019s NHS Nightingale coronavirus hospital was vandalised over the Easter weekend.\n> \n> In Holland, meanwhile, authorities have characterised the perpetrators of mast attacks as hooligans engaging in a \u201cEuropean Championship of Mast Burnings\u201d.\n> \n> \u201cThis is not just a nuisance, it is much more serious than that,\u201d said Mats Granryd, chief executive of the GSMA trade body. \u201cWe cannot let crackpots damage what we have built up.\u201d\n> \n> In an effort to curb the effects of the conspiracy, authorities have been forced to step in to publicly discredit it. The World Health Organisation this month denied any link between the spread of the coronavirus and 5G, while the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection said that 5G signals posed no risk to human health.\n> \n> Piers Corbyn, the brother of former Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn and a high-profile campaigner against 5G in the UK, dismissed the WHO\u2019s points, arguing that the use of high frequencies could be damaging particles in people\u2019s lungs. \u201cI understand why people are getting angry,\u201d he said of the mast attacks.\n> \n> In the UK, the theories have even seeped onto mainstream television, alarming broadcasters and the regulator Ofcom. During a segment about \u201cfake news\u201d on ITV\u2019s popular daytime show This Morning on Monday, replacement host Eamonn Holmes defended those who did not believe the \u201cstate-run narrative\u201d about 5G and coronavirus. The incident prompted Ofcom to immediately announce an inquiry into the programme.\n> \n> \u2018People want answers\u2019\n> \n> In response to the 5G conspiracy, social media platforms have reshaped their policies to take action against misinformation on the subject. Earlier this month, YouTube updated its policies to ban all videos that suggest that coronavirus symptoms are caused by 5G. Facebook, too, has decided to remove \u201cfalse claims linking coronavirus to 5G\u201d.\n> \n> Nevertheless, the measures have not eliminated all conspiracy-related content from these platforms \u2014 nor prevented it from springing up elsewhere. On TikTok, which Ms Linderst\u00e5l said is emerging as a \u201cvery powerful tool\u201d for conspiracy theorists targeting younger people, videos can still be found using the search terms \u201c5G\u201d and \u201ccoronavirus\u201d.\n> \n> One popular video, which has since been removed by the platform, showed a woman berating a construction worker over how the technology was going to \u201ckill everyone\u201d, while characterising the emergency London coronavirus hospital as a \u201cconcentration camp\u201d.\n> \n> When a collection of these videos were shown to TikTok by the FT, the company said it did \u201cnot allow misinformation that could harm the community, but added, \u201cwe are removing any harmful material of this nature, and we will continue to further strengthen our protective measures in this area\u201d.\n> \n> Meanwhile researchers are racing to assess whether and to what extent efforts to spread the conspiracy theories are co-ordinated. Jonathan Morgan, chief executive of misinformation tracking group Yonder, said that there had been a \u201cconcerted effort by the anti-vaccination community\u201d to spread 5G conspiracy theories.\n> \n> But some experts have also pointed to overt propaganda efforts by Russian state media to push such narratives. A recent YouTube video published by RT suggested that children playing near 5G cell towers could suffer cancer, nose bleeds and learning disabilities. Other researchers have raised the possibility of covert state-backed campaigns \u2014 though to date, none of the social media platforms have announced concrete evidence of clandestine foreign operations focused on the topic.\n> \n> The theory has also been pushed by so-called \u201cQAnon\u201d conspiracy theorists, who believe there is a secret anti-Trump plot under way by the \u201cdeep state\u201d.\n> \n> \u201cIt conveniently touches on a deep state, UN-level paranoia because [the rollout of 5G] requires global collaboration,\u201d said Ed Bice, chief executive of non-profit Meedan, which builds digital media verification software.\n> \n> In addition to questions over the source of the conspiracy, another big unknown remains: why it has taken such a dramatic hold in Europe in particular.\n> \n> Ms Linderst\u00e5l argued that the strict lockdown is likely to be playing a part. \u201cPeople are really scared but they are also really engaged,\u201d she said. \u201cAt a time of crisis, people want answers \u2014 and [5G] is a really simple answer.\u201d", "created_utc": 1587020815.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnkba2n", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_g2a2kh", "parent_id": "t3_g2a2kh", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnkba2n", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/g2a2kh/how_a_5g_coronavirus_conspiracy_spread_across/fnkba2n/"}
