It didn't change based on where we were.\n\n>The will never be a day in which the find out that the cause of the virus is a wireless data network.\n\nAgreed. But the point is that you don't get to decide where the line is between what can be said and what can't. There is a reason free speech is the first amendment, even if people get to spout bullshit. The costs far outweigh the pros of censoring people\n\nAnd on another note, even though it is literally physically impossible for a data network to spread a virus, that doesn't mean that there might not be any health risks involved at all. Shutting a legitimate concern down because of a few people isn't a very good reaction either.", "created_utc": 1586185169.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmlf5j4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmkise1", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmlf5j4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmlf5j4/"}
