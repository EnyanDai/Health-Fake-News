This increases the rate of mutation of viral RNA in the mitochondrial structures through RDS-alpha movement of choline receptors and in over 2500 cases this increased transmission by 27.5%. Pgs 15-17 Rollins, Wu, Goldstein, From Harvard Medical Journal\"\n\nI made all that up. But I think if someone had a sufficient arsenal of fancy science words and was speaking from a place of authority they could probably fool the right person with their bullshit. \n\nI think you and I know that 5G towers don't spread illness not because we could actually question the theory with facts, because we probably couldn't, could we? It's more like a reasonable assumption that this is a hoax based on the experience that mass conspiracies are uncommon and some random person on social media is unlikely to be the person to reveal them.\n\nIf I had to guess, maybe belief in conspiracies is something explained better by sociology? Someone who distrusts authority or feels alienated for some reason might be more inclined to buy into alternative hypotheses that also have the correct cast of good guys vs. bad guys. I'm sure the opposite is also true and explains this clickbait headline. So a couple of people in a country with over 50 million burn down 4 cell phone towers out of what must be thousands or more, does that signify \"people across Britain\"? But it's comforting for liberal-ish upper class people who are probably distressed by Trump and Brexit and have drifted to Business Insider and The Guardian as their preferred news source to be reminded by the fact that the lower classes are a bunch of toothless hicks who are clearly too stupid to know what is best for them.", "created_utc": 1586095630.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmhw82c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmhm5y6", "score": 68, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586096095.0, "name": "t1_fmhw82c", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmhw82c/"}
