If its harmful is the question though. 5g wavelengths are under a millimeter whereas 3g/4g can be .08m-.4m, which lets it penetrate better. FM is larger wavelength than that. IR like a TV remote is 1mm though, so maybe I should have actually thought this out. UV is like 10nm and can cause skin cancer.\n\nMar 12, 2020 a radioactivity watchdog declared it safe. That's good, last I looked into it not many studies were out.  The smaller the wave the more you absorb. Which is why UV is worse for your skin than IR.\n\nhttps://www.androidauthority.com/5g-dangers-895776/\n\nHeres an extremely opinionated article that explains why the study I had previously seen (and mentioned) was not credible. The study showed correlation between certain cancers in rats and mm radiation. But I also sleep by an IR heater, so obviously I dont mind 1mm radiation.\n\nThe only other bad side is how much more power it draws, but that makes sense that youd need more power to make higher freqs and get past data ceilings", "created_utc": 1586949841.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngystr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngw2nx", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586950795.0, "name": "t1_fngystr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngystr/"}
