This sub is surprisingly dismissive of links between covid and 5g. Based off of my own personal research, I do think what you're saying is true. 5G isn't the only cause of whatever this coronavirus really is but there is a definite link. And maybe it was the start of this whole thing.\n\nPeople gotta remember that reddit is partly owned by china. And technology is only getting more advanced. It would be easy to establish the plausible narrative that 5G is bad but is not related to coronavirus. I would not be surprised if that has happened in this sub. Because we KNOW they are doing more than just watching. And I find it hard to believe that it's a coincidence that Wuhan was the first city in China to have widespread 5G and then an eventual pandemic starts there.", "created_utc": 1586482807.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmyc88b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fxr6sc", "parent_id": "t3_fxr6sc", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmyc88b", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fxr6sc/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmyc88b/"}
