Common activities that can cause human-animal interaction include farming, hunting, ranching and keeping animals as pets. Human-animal contact is also heightened when humans encroach on wild lands\"\n(Source: WHO, Report on emerging zoonotic diseases)\n\nFurthermore, one of the leading causes of encroachment on wild lands is animal agriculture, due to it involving vast amounts of habitat destruction. The most comprehensive analysis ever conducted exploring farming and the environment concluded that a shift to a plant based diet would free up 75 percent of global agricultural land. Land that could then be re-wilded and would ultimately reduce human encroachment onto wild lands.\n\nIt's just a fact that if we didn't farm, and hunt, animals for food and sport then these diseases would not have killed millions:\n\n[Ebola - The hunting of animals](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190124095156.htm)\n\n[vCJD - Eating cattle infected with BSE](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-health-literacy/all-about-bse-mad-cow-disease)\n\n[Swine Flu - Traced back to US pig farms](https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/cdcresponse.htm)\n\n[Avian Flu - Poultry markets and farms](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02757-4)\n\n[HIV - Hunting of chimpanzees](https://www.avert.org/professionals/history-hiv-aids/origin)\n\n[SARS - Civet cat at a Chinese wet market](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/03/16/%20coronavirus-fact-check-where-did-covid-19-start-experts-say-china/5053783002/)", "created_utc": 1585903627.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmaqcwz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ftsgvk", "parent_id": "t1_fma6vzb", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmaqcwz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/ftsgvk/uk_media_outlets_told_not_to_promote_baseless_5g/fmaqcwz/"}
