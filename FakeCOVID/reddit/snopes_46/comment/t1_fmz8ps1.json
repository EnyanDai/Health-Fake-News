Even wearing a cloth mask can decrease the rate of infection by 30%. If you are civilian, wear something around your face, even if it a t-shirt turned into a mask. As long as it is covering your face. Wear a scuba mask if you have one, the point is that you are not spreading to others. If you get infected, youre shit out of luck but you are not spreading it.\n\nThen governments stop relying on other countries, immediately subsidize as many local producers as possible. Order the machines, assemble them and produce the FFP2 masks for your hospitals. Most of these machines are automated line machines as well.\n\nIn the mean time you can still order from China and other countries but this way you are reducing your domestic demand and diversifying your supply.", "created_utc": 1586510826.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmz8ps1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fmz1ntc", "score": -3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmz8ps1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fmz8ps1/"}
