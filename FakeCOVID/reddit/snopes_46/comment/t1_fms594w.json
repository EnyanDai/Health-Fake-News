That, to me, is very much LIKE the logic of a solipsist, and I get that you aren't espousing those beliefs but it's just tremendously aggravating to see anyone say \"Hm well ya never know for sure!\" to something that's so clearly horseshit devised to make a living for a fear-mongering grifter that believes climate change is a hoax. \n\nSorry, genuinely, this is way more than I wanted to get into this but the people that believe this shit just evade and deflect, and I guess I have a hard time abiding by otherwise sensible people having soft reactions to these lies", "created_utc": 1586346982.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fms594w", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwkcwo", "parent_id": "t1_fms0zg8", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fms594w", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwkcwo/youtube_tightens_rules_after_david_icke_5g/fms594w/"}
