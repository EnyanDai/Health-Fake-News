The main pipe running down your street normally has enough water for everyone on the street, but the builder chose to put a particular size pipe to your house. \n\nIt\u2019s fine for pressure if you open one tap, even two, but if you open every tap in your house, you\u2019re going to lose pressure because there simply isn\u2019t enough water to give. \n\nThen the builder or developer will need to put a bigger pipe in to let more water through at the same time. \n\nI hope that made sense. (And I hope that providers are buying extra bandwidth). \n\nSource: I used to work for iiNet in their fibre team.", "created_utc": 1583991863.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fka45qw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fhb7ek", "parent_id": "t3_fhb7ek", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fka45qw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/australia/comments/fhb7ek/is_the_nbn_and_4g5g_coronavirusready/fka45qw/"}
