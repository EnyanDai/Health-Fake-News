How does a particular wavelength of energy that is well understood equate to a virus we can observe with a microscope. How in the hell do people think this? \n\nI get why people don't believe in evolution (it's dumb, but if your a literal with the Bible it does say the world was created 7K years ago). I get vaccine denial because there was a fuckface MD who got an article regarding a fictional link to autism published about it in a reputable journal. I even get why people may think the world is flat, because it is a hard to imagine the invisible force that is gravity magically gluing us to this round bal in space. But 5G? Not one reputable person thinks that's plausible. There is no ammount of mental gymnastics that makes this make any sense. \n\nAnd all this science denial makes me (a MSc. Chemist by training) extremely sad. Like WTF. For a thing to happen there needs to be a plausible thing that happens. It's like saying turning on the lights in your room is how people wake up, ignoring that people can wake up in the dark.", "created_utc": 1587233994.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnt3ntv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "parent_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnt3ntv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/g3n9zq/no_5g_does_not_spread_coronavirus/fnt3ntv/"}
