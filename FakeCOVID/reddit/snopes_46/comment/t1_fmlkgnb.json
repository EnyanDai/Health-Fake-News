Transmitters are far weaker and will require much more dense positioning of transmitters in populated areas.\n\nOther frequencies did have a lot of concern and retroactively have been found to be harmful to people located very close to transmitters over long periods, just as living near powerlines has shown similar results.  The difference with 5G is that nearly everyone will be living near a transmitter. \n\nI am not on the Corona 5G bandwagon, nor do I think everything I stated is an actual concern.  I do however get concerned with the extensive number of trial areas and health evaluations that have been done on every other previous frequency (1G, 2G, 3G, 4G) while 5G is getting a rapid rollout.  If it is an issue, we will all be fucked before we realize it's an issue.
