I'm going to choose to [trust the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48616174) on this.\n\nPeople have at least [some reason to be afraid](https://www.rfsafe.com/5g-network-uses-nearly-same-frequency-as-weaponized-crowd-control-systems/) because 5G is on a much higher frequency than 4G and other G technology before it. That's why even the experts can't seem to agree if the technology is safe.\n\nSo far the people who aren't career scientists who are automatically saying \"it's safe\" haven't bothered doing their own research. The research is actually a lot more mixed than people suspect, and I've already expressed that I'm more than willing to see some test runs of this technology rather than automatically give in to full blown rollouts that could cause some problems down the line.\n\nI'm just trying to say that [5G is closer to microwave radiation](https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/79mI246KV5GTBZ_z3iWNWsKbB2I=/940x0/2019/06/20/5b979ea9-4900-41a4-874e-6de332fe96d9/spectrum.png) than we have ever seen in previous cell phone frequencies.\n\nOn top of all this, it's worth reiterating that the [5G wavelength has a lot of difficulty actually penetrating buildings or reaching intended destinations](https://www.telit.com/blog/understanding-5g-spectrum-bands-allocations/). It's main benefit is that it's fast. REALLY fast. Much faster than what we're used to.", "created_utc": 1586967406.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnhr5aq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnhp29t", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnhr5aq", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnhr5aq/"}
