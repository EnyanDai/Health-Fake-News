I haven't looked it up\" or \"what's the source they cite? Do you think you would trust it?\" \n\nThere's not going to be any \"convincing\" by you, all you can do is ask questions and let her get to the truth. More often than not she may be frustrated and walk away, but that's okay because being wrong is embarrassing. \n\nAnd DON'T EVER say \"I told you so\" or make a big deal when she agrees with you or you turn out to be right.
