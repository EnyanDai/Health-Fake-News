When the government announced a 35% cap on use and that Huawei wouldn't be near core infrastructure and even that they wouldn't be allowed near physical equipment near key infrastructure (Power plants, military bases, etc) that should have been the end of it - and it largely was in the Telecoms and IT industries.\n\nIt feels as if this is a lot of panic by people who aren't clued up on networking. Whether your mast, router or switch is made by Huawei, Cisco or Netgear isn't really relevant, who's operating it and responsible for the security of it is, and it isn't Huawei.", "created_utc": 1587215012.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fns7lux", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3iiuz", "parent_id": "t1_fnrotsn", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fns7lux", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/g3iiuz/uk_moves_to_drop_huawei_as_5g_vendor_citing_china/fns7lux/"}
