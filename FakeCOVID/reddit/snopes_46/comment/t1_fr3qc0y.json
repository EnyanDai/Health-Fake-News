Some questions are \r\nrepeated regularly (such as political preference and leadership approval), while others are unique to each week and reflect current media and social issues. \r\nThe response rate varies each week, but usually delivers 1000+ interviews. In theory, with a sample of this size, there is 95 per cent certainty that the results are \r\nwithin 3 percentage points of what they would be if the entire population had been polled. However, this assumes random sampling, which, because of non-\r\nresponse and less than 100% population coverage cannot be achieved in practice. Furthermore, there are other possible sources of error in all polls including \r\nquestion wording and question order, interviewer bias (for telephone and face-to-face polls), response errors and weighting.\r\nThe online omnibus is live from the Wednesday night and closed on the following Sunday. Incentives are offered to participants. Essential Research uses the \r\nStatistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software to analyse the data. The data is weighted against Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data.\r\nAll Essential Research staff hold Australian Market and Social Research Society (AMSRS) membership and are bound by professional codes of behaviour.\n\nSo...
