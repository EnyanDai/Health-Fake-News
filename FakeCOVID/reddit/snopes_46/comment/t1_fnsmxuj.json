The universe would never hurt you, specifically.  Other people are less deserving, but *you* are special.  If something bad happens, it's because a bad person or thing is trying to *hurt* you!  It might be a government conspiracy, demons, chemicals (avoid DHMO!), there are so many different schools of thought.  You *know* bad things don't happen to good people, not good people like you, unless something bad makes it happen!  Why would a perfectly ordinary thing like a virus, just like the many many plagues that have regularly cut a path through human history affect *you*?  Impossible!\n\nAdd in a side of \"Smartest person in the room\" when *you* know more than these so-called \"experts\" with their degrees from fancy universities and years of studying.
