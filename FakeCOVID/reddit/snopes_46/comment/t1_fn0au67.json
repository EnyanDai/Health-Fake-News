First of all, not American. Second, the US is not the end result of communism.\n\nTrying to pretend that is the case is dishonest and a fraudulent representation of history... you're about as disgusting and dishonest as someone claiming the Civil War was about state rights. That's who you are.\n\nIn China and the USSR there were revolutions based on communist principles.\n\nAnd of course your last comment is whataboutism. LOL. What a shock. \"WHAT ABOUT AMERICA THEY DID BAD STUFF TOO\". And you know what? It's openly discussed in America what their policies have done, what their actions have done. There's lots of criticism including from incredibly intelligent people like yourself. Try that in Russia or China and let me know how it goes.\n\nYou're the equivalent of a white nationalist in the South screaming \"STATES RIGHTS NOT SLAVERY\".
