A bit late answer here. I agree on that rigor should be conducted when analyzing the writer of the paper and the context it is written in to determine the quality. Myself I have some training in biology, and can at least hopefully make some semi-educated guessing from that I suppose, and it seems you have more experience of the physical effects side of things. Seems like good place to start a discussion about science.  Also think you are correct on technical points you made about the blog post.\n\nMy point in citing the 50's paper was to say that we have been aware that emf in large doses can be harmful for some time. Example  [https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19532703424](https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19532703424) (poor animals in science) or a review article on the subject in 1973  [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4103113/references#references](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4103113/references#references). It is a point that most of these older articles seems use radiations that goes above today's safety standards.  \n\n\nMore moderns problems however seems to be with bees and pollinators:  [https://www.stralingsarmvlaanderen.org/resources/Ved-Parkash-Sharma\\_a49823b5aa.pdf](https://www.stralingsarmvlaanderen.org/resources/Ved-Parkash-Sharma_a49823b5aa.pdf) \n\nor some doubts about us humans from an Israeli study:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29459303](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29459303) \n\nIn summary it seems there is some doubt on the biological side. In the absence of really good long term studies on humans  with large sample sizes with the planed implemented tech. It seems seems prudent to hold your horses for a awhile. In context, it took a long while (30-40 years in some places) from when radioactivity was suspected to be dangerous to an implemented ban, except with limited uses cases. Also think it's cool with new tech and cool solutions, but not at the expense of something else, having both cool tech and overall good health seems awesome.", "created_utc": 1586375231.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmtmerd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmj5ykw", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmtmerd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmtmerd/"}
