Complete confidence in a complete lack of knowledge is a dangerous mindset especially if you're going around talking about it.\n\nYou're right, [this subject](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/nonionizing_radiation.html) has been [heavily studied](https://www.jrseco.com/wp-content/uploads/Man-made-and-Natural-EMF-EMR-Dr.Leendert-Vries.pdf) and pretty much [everything](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14914) you've said here is wrong. To quote the summary of just one of these sources:\n\n\"The man-made EMF thus induce currents, resonant interactions and interferences \u2013 involving charged and polar particles and surfaces and magnetic particles - in our body. These interactions and the absorption can lead to harmful biological processes and to interference with the biological processes already going on.\n\nThe natural EMR, although having a much higher intensity, does not have any effect inside. Most of it does not penetrate our skin and the part that penetrates has field strengths equal to zero and therefore does not exert any force.\"\n\nIf it's as simple as walking outside and looking up, why are governments and coalitions of thousands of scientists around the world petitioning (for years at this point) to delay the technologies? Grow the hell up and don't forget the sunscreen because that was about the only thing you were right about here. People are certainly silly, I won't disagree with you there, we just disagree on who is acting silly.", "created_utc": 1587256208.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnu7moe", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntsb91", "score": -6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587256399.0, "name": "t1_fnu7moe", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnu7moe/"}
