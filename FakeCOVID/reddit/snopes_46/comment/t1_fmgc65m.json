The same wave used in crowd dispersion weapons. \n\nOf course they say the amperage won\u2019t be that high but do you really want telecom companies to have tech that can be pin pointed. Think of them as wifi bullets. The LTE we have now is like a large bubble and we use wifi/internet within it.\n\n3G was like LTE but wasn\u2019t a bubble and would be a triangulation between towers that shot out radio waves like a pizza slice \ud83c\udf55 \n\nNow 5G uses an all new type of radiation (all waves from blue tooth to microwaves are forms of radiation. They are just non ionized radiation)\n\nIt uses optics and tech inside of them that will shoot very high frequency beams directly into the phone or device that needs to connect. Along with the recent development of mid earth orbit satellites and the installation of thousand of 5G hubs to reflect this beam to all the phones.\n\nNow the current set up can not be used to harm us physically. These new towers would only need to have the main amperage brought up and it could be used to cause a lot of harm. \n\nI\u2019m not saying they would do this but I don\u2019t think phone companies should have even the ability to do that.", "created_utc": 1586045768.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmgc65m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "score": -4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmgc65m", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmgc65m/"}
