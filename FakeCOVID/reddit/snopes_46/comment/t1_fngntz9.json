If you know a single thing about any topic he's discussing you can immediately see him for the kid doing a book report on the book he didn't read. He never says anything of substance. He never gives any details. It's because he knows nothing, but he just speaks in broad moronic terms with confidence and that's enough for some people who also know nothing about the topic.
