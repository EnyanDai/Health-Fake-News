If I lived in fear of every crackpot screeching conspiracies, nothing would get done.\n\nIf I searched hard enough, there is probably writings about how the first light (a candle) threatened health and cut life expectancy short.\n\nNewspapers got viewed as being antisocial tools, same thing cell phones get today. History repeats itself in a tight loop of stupidity. Just the fear/phobia changes it\u2019s name and type.\n\nShould we be concerned? Probably. But in the end, what can be done about it? Pretty much nothing. There are myriad facets to a issue that can\u2019t be covered by a one size fits all solution.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve always wondered is at what point is a baseline considered for a life lived? Folks have barely turned 18 and been taken off the planet via cancer. Or a plane crash, car wreck, homicide, etc.\n\nMy grandfather drank himself silly and died at the age of 75 give or take. His wife died when she was 66. Folks from the decade they were born in are now dying off in their 80s.\n\nAgain, what\u2019s the baseline for a life lived? Fearing death is hammered into people from a young age. But it comes eventually in any form.\n\nFor all I know, my clock is ticking from exposure to a old enemy of the past asbestos. Tore up linoleum flooring from a house built in 94 that still used asbestos (Armstrong) which is known to have existed as late as 2000.\n\nDo I keel in my 40s from that, or something else? Or do I hit my 80s then drop over from it or a poor diet?\n\nNo one knows. The big elephant in the room is all causes of death are generic. What takes one person down many others survive. And it\u2019s all dependent on factors out of anyone\u2019s control from genetics to whatever scare of the month some YouTube/Facebook tin foil nut job screeches about", "created_utc": 1583246364.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjd5vct", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_fcs579", "parent_id": "t1_fjd1u7m", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r40j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjd5vct", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/lostgeneration/comments/fcs579/facebook_stupidity_strikes_again_coronavirus_and/fjd5vct/"}
