There was an AMA on r/Iama from 5g engineers,installers ect....people are worried about the fact the 5g towers use millimeter waves. The professionals doing the AMA also admitted there was very little heath testing done and it even concerned them. There is also very little safety back-up to keep from malfunctioning or possible access by a malicious groups. If the frequency of the millimeters waves go above a certain point it turns into the exact thing military uses as a weapon. \n\nSo not everyone is against 5g..  they just want more in depth testing because it uses millimeter waves. Those can also be a weapon capable of killing. Most people in military,navy ect will tell you, do not stand close to radars. Some utilize millimeter waves. One was even quoted saying \"they can cook you\" so the fact these are going up next to schools,parks,and crowded areas should be concerning considering the professionals themselves admit the testing was very weak.....just putting that out there.\n\n**AMA from Radar Engineer with a masters degree in Telecommunication Engineering and a teaching qualification in high school physics! tons of great info first link**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fx27ie/recently_the_5g_causes_covid19_conspiracy_theory/\n\nhttps://www.saferemr.com/2017/09/5g-wireless-technology-is-5g-harmful-to.html?m=1\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118300355\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency\n\nEdit: links,tag", "created_utc": 1586933865.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngj443", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "score": -12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586938742.0, "name": "t1_fngj443", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngj443/"}
