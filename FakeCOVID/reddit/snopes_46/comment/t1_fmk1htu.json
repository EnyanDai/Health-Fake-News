You cannot biologically fly.  It doesn't matter how much you really really want to.  In fact, you could even try it.  Lot's of people have thought that doesn't apply to themselves.  I understand that you are reserving your superior logical analysis, and sure, you should undoubtedly be skeptical of a lot of things.  But don't be ridiculous.  As I said again, it doesn't really matter what your personal opinion on a truth is, if it's wrong.  Then your opinion is wrong too.  And while we could down the rabbit hole of \"truths\" forever and philosophers have been debating this for centuries, there are certain things that are just demonstrably proven absolutely 100% with no room for question, truths or facts.  No matter what you think about it.  Unfortunately, a lot of people are fucking stupid and incapable of changing their dogmas even when proven wrong, and that's the problem.  I can PROVE to you that Sean Hannity and Donald Trump minimized to the public the dangers of Coronavirus.  I can show you a video of Hannity saying that the Coronavirus was a hoax perpetuated by Democrats to undermine and impeach Donald Trump, and demonize and destroy the President.  I can show you a video of Donald Trump saying the virus is nothing to worry about and it's not serious and Americans will be unaffected by it.  The PROBLEM is there is a minority that either doesn't remember that is what those men said, don't believe that's what they said, or choose to ignore what they said in the past.  So apply those principles away, on more questionable cases I guess.", "created_utc": 1586142303.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmk1htu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmjviky", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmk1htu", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmk1htu/"}
