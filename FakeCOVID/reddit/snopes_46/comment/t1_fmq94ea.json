He truly believes in lizard people and is HEAVILY into the \"5G Causes Corona\" theory. He sends video after video to my fiance and the shitty part is that... well... he's starting to believe it. \n\nMy fiance is naive and gullible. I love him to death but he's an antivaxer (I chose to ignore that at first, since he doesn't ever really bring it up and we aren't having chidren) but now it's getting worse. He just dropped hundreds on naturopathic drs for some lung issues he's having and is spending god knows how much money on mother fucking alkaline water, all because his friend recommends it. Also a bunch of detoxifying shit for his body. And as someone with kidney disease I find it so insulting how stupid you can be. \n\nHe refuses to tell me how much he spent, he insists it's not much, but I overheard him telling his daughter not to spill his 'medicine' because it cost him a fortune... \n\nOk I'm rambling sorry. But these conspiracy theorists who keep saying that we are sheeple for believing everything the government tells us are hypocrits. They believe everything that the other CT's are saying, and their source of information is really just Youtube. \n\nI told my fiance that youtube is banning the 5G videos and he said... \"That's because they don't want you to know the truth!\". \n\nHow the hell can you still be in love with someone you lose nearly all respect for? Because of this he isn't taking this seriously. He has lung issues (just some lung inflammation from allergies), his daughter and son have asthma, and I have end stage kidney disease. We are the kind of people who are definitely supposed to be taking it seriously JUST IN CASE BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW. \n\nThanks for reading y'all!", "created_utc": 1586295197.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmq94ea", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwkcwo", "parent_id": "t1_fmp2yr4", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmq94ea", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwkcwo/youtube_tightens_rules_after_david_icke_5g/fmq94ea/"}
