It\u2019s not people burning down cell towers that are ruining this planet. I\u2019m guessing the original comment poster doesn\u2019t realize that their McDonald\u2019s lunches and unsustainable lifestyle contribute more towards the downfall of the planet then some passionate (and misguided) activists. Sad affairs when we\u2019re turning on each other and not asking questions like why don\u2019t we trust our governments. A couple google searches of previous confirmed and admitted past programs prove that the government is more than capable of poisoning or experimenting on it\u2019s own people. Just look up \u201ctuskegee experiments\u201d if you want to see what our governments are more than alright doing to any citizens they deem \u201cexpendable\u201d. They straight up infected a bunch of African Americans with disease to see the results. The US government did this, and has declassified and admitted doing it. But go on and trick yourself into believe that it was in the past, and now they magically do care about us. This is just one of the MANY things that they have done to their own people. No, I\u2019m not a Trump loving conspiracy nut (they scare me almost as much as complacent people like you do), but I\u2019m also not one one to jump in with the herd and turn on anyone who\u2019s lashing out against oppression. Though I agree the way they are trying to accomplish it is rash and not educated enough. I\u2019ll still take them over the politicians and general herd any day though", "created_utc": 1586944508.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngtmqd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngj17s", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngtmqd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngtmqd/"}
