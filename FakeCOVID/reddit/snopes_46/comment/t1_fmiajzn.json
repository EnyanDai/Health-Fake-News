Eventually, even \"covidiots\", as they are called, will know someone in their own life who has died from this pandemic.\n\nHowever, as someone who has a concern about possible long-term side effects of 5G (effects that will take decades to surface and are comparable to how it took decades for big tobacco to pay the piper), I share the same concern as everyone else about these particular idiots.  How can one logically believe 5G is spreading a virus in non 5G countries?  These people make anyone wary of 5G look bad.  We can't help the fact that some people are just plain morons.  Usually lack of logic / over emotionality, low IQ, and impulsive / destructive action are traits that go together in the same individual, so I would put forth the argument that these particular idiots would have behaved like this regardless of which topic or idea they latched onto.  In comparison, most sane people who had early concerns about smoking  did not go out and destroy tobacco company property.  They just patiently put up with the smoke for decades and waited for society to catch up.\n\nSo I agree with you that we should stop giving these people our attention.", "created_utc": 1586105722.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmiajzn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmi3mea", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmiajzn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmiajzn/"}
