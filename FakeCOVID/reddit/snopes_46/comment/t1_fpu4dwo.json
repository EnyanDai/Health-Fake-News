Rude, polite, genuine, aggressive, passive, sarcastic, helpful, lots more. Though I don't have a silver bullet for what works, I can tell you that.. any attacking or negative approach is essentially guaranteed to make a person buckle down HARDER in their beliefs. You may already have that insight - Kindness, respect and listening are going to be components of any and all successful approaches, as painful as that may be (for all parties lol) \n\nConspiracy can appeal to people for lots of reasons. Maybe you can do some reading online about why people believe conspiracies, and see if any of the theories ring true for your dad. For example, sometimes if folks aren't super intelligent, conspiracy knowledge will appeal to them because it's a way of appearing and feeling more intelligent than most \"normies\" or whatever. Some other people can feel like they're doing positive or \"patriotic\" work by spreading the word (they can then feel like a hero or look for praise/recognition online, be a pundit, always have good \"water cooler\" chit chat that's controversial, etc etc)\n\nIt feels good to be right - it's hard to ask people to throw away that feeling. They don't usually want to. (And when they've altered their standards of what \"being right\" means, it can be even harder.)", "created_utc": 1588904413.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpu4dwo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpu10zp", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpu4dwo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpu4dwo/"}
