I hate to be \u201cthat guy\u201d but a majority of funded science is controversial.\n\nAll of academia is political and as much as we would like to believe scientists are always being truthful I frakly don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case in a lot of \u201cbig\u201d studies.\n\nLots of scientists conduct research that is funded with a very specific goal/results in mind which is not sound science. The parameters that are setup to figure out the effects of 5g never actually recreate what 5g does in a realistic setting around people.\n\nSomething that so heavily interacts with membrane bi layers makes me uncomfortable considering there really isn\u2019t concrete studies on what these companies are using.\n\nAlso - I don\u2019t think 5g is some super killing device (lol from what I know) but I do think it has potential to disrupt biological processes and probably certain pathways in cellular systems.", "created_utc": 1584727376.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl1egce", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fl9od5", "parent_id": "t1_fl16ngx", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn7", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584727596.0, "name": "t1_fl1egce", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/biology/comments/fl9od5/whats_the_best_way_to_shut_down_people_who_say/fl1egce/"}
