Religion as a whole is otherwise a cancer on the human mind and in a just world would be called out as the bullshit it is.   \nBut beside its malign nature its more a symptom of human ignorance and gullibility, i have to deal with and love some religious people but i feel less proud to be human every time i hear their mind numbing chants.   \nSometimes i would prefer to be the gullible moron thinking that humans and myself is the center of the universe and everything is according to some divine plan, but i cant delude myself to that extent and im doomed to forever be a bitter and depressed person.   \nEither position is wrong and there does not seem to be a right way about it, either a blissful moron or a cynical asshole.", "created_utc": 1586121112.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj1fp6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmis5k9", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj1fp6", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmj1fp6/"}
