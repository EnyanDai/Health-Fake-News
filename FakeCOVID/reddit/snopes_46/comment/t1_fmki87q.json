One side feeds the other and it's like a perpetual motion meme.\n\nBut the effect is that every time somebody says they disagree with or dislike something about a 5G implementation they get insulted and shouted down as if they believe using a phone can cause a viral infection or something else equally idiotic.\n\nI don't see who benefits from that except for the telecomm companies installing the e.g [400,000 extra masts in Britain](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/03/30/400000-extra-phone-masts-needed-bring-5g-network-rural-britain/), and the equipment providers who themselves are in conflict with the NSA because Huawei won't play ball with surveillance. Do you remember that whole campaign? Where the US banned Huawei and then tried to convince the EU to do the same. But Huawei responded by giving the EU massive discounts.\n\nGovernments stand to make billions from selling licenses, companies stand to make billions from users, and equipment providers stand to make billions in infrastructure sales. When there is that much money (and surveillance data) at stake, and if I were in a position of authority, I know I would pay a PR company to meme the fuck out of the idea that any criticism of 5G is shockingly stupid. I would need those 400,000 British masts to get planning permission. \n\nThat's not to say all or even any of the posts made here every few hours come from PR companies. But I'm starting to think people are taking the other side of the campaign as 100% genuine and reacting to it.", "created_utc": 1586155828.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmki87q", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvnxyq", "parent_id": "t1_fmkfsd5", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmki87q", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ireland/comments/fvnxyq/no_5g_does_not_spread_coronavirus/fmki87q/"}
