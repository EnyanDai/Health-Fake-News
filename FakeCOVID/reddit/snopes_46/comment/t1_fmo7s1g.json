And while Internet Explorer was a huge piece of shit and Microsoft pulled some real shady shit, in retrospect it seems almost quaint to imagine a time when people were outraged that a browser came with an operating system. And as I recall, Internet Explorer eventually got beat out in the market when better products came along.\n\nThird, Youtube has competition from Vimeo, Dailymotion, LiveLeak, Break, and even Facebook/Instagram, not to mention the media served by Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc, as well as one more company that has over 100 million daily visitors that you've probably used but never heard of: MindGeek. They own almost all of the porn tube websites and they're absolutely massive. As a bit of a side note on them, they're *far* more predatory than Youtube. Mindgeek hosts insane amounts of pirated content. They've also bought out a lot of the porn studios. Somewhat ironically, they even pirate all of *that* content, too.
