If someone has to use a god that they never met to have a moral compass fearing eternal damnation  or seeking peace and happiness in it's presence forever after death then that is fine if they are following it and not harming others in the process. \n\nIf someone believes crystals cleanse the soul and help purify the body if they aren't harming anyone in the process then that's also fine. \n\nIf someone needs no outside encouragement for a strong moral compass and believes that when we die that's it; Game Over. As long as they are not hurting anybody in the process then that is fine. \n\nIf someone believe that heaven is a chocolate train that rides on licorice rails across the cosmos and that god is a monkey that farts out lollipops and they want to be on that train when they die. As long as the are not harming anybody in the process then who the fuck cares. \n\nNot all atheists are smart not all people who believe in a God or a being more powerful than themselves are idiots. \n\nBoth camps have their fair share of imbeciles. I could have used any word in place of god. Fuck, Hell, piss, sam hill, tarnation.  If I would have stated \"how the hell do people begin to think that 5g or any electronic device could cause a virus.\" You might not have said anything about how the \" people who are gullible enough to believe in a hell.....\" \n\nNow I know i can't prove a negative. But for fuck's sake the amount of self-righteous Atheists who have made this kind of comment is just a bit too high. This wasn't a statement about a god or theism so why did you feel the need to make it one?", "created_utc": 1587250923.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fntyawz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntochn", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fntyawz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fntyawz/"}
