Power level is far more important than the frequency. That's my point. So long as we're talking about radiation below the frequency of UV (non-ionizing radiation), then the only way they can harm you is by the power level (by literally heating up parts of you body, like a microwave oven). So this fear of 5G because its \"ultra high frequency\" is silly.\n\n>Normal ovens heat the air inside the oven and that heat transfers to the food by conduction\n\nNot really. There are 3 main types of heat transfer. Conduction, Convection, and Radiation. Unless you have a convection oven or you're putting your food directly on the heating elements, the primary method of heat transfer is radiation. There will be some convection from hot air moving around, but not as much as the radiation heat transfer. If your oven contained a perfect vacuum, it could still cook food just as well without any air (although, i'm not sure how well anything would bake without any oxygen). \n\nA stove top does use conduction, but it (like any hot thing) also emits the same thermal-infrared radiation as an oven, and that radiation is still absorbed by your body (hence the reason you can feel the heat without touching it, and the same way you warm up in direct sunlight).", "created_utc": 1586361877.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmstrfv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t1_fmryrh8", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmstrfv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmstrfv/"}
