People are angry at corporations installing 5g without proper health and safety testing during a global pandemic against the publics say, a fight thats been going on for years (mind you i do NOT condone going after the workers themselves just doing their job).\n\n[There are many credible scientists that are weary that 5G could cause alot of side effects to nature and to our health](https://www.5gappeal.eu/) (been on this since 2017)\n\n[Research shows it causes cancer in rats](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/high-exposure-radiofrequency-radiation-linked-tumor-activity-male-rats)\n\n[Cell phone radio frequencies can increase chance Glioma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158328/) (brain tumors)\n\nTo call the people fighting to keep themselves safe from potentially harmful radio frequencies [that will blanket entire cities effecting young and old to a degree that has not been seen before](https://www.cio.com/article/3117705/5g-could-require-cell-towers-on-every-street-corner.html)is very disingenuous. [A grid that would allow individual tracking comparable to what china is currently doing](https://issues.org/china-and-5g/)\n\n[We already know that even the wifi we are currently using can cause a host of negative health consequences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118300355), imagine that [taken to tighter frequency bands at higher voltages (closing in on microwave radiation wavebands.](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/we-have-no-reason-to-believe-5g-is-safe/))\n\nThere are many valid reasons to hold off on 5g installation. Its not stupid to be skeptical that large amounts of radiation might be unsafe, or that a vast information network like this might be use to further subvert individuals freedoms.
