But electromagnetic radiation is harmful to our cells in general. All radiation can lower your immune system. It's why nurses stand behind those big lead blocks whilst you have your x-ray. \n\nI'm not against 3G/4G/5G, I personally love the internet. But I think we need to be more honest and objective about how these technologies can cause harm to us. It's about controlling your exposure, I for instance put my phone on airplane mode every night, and my sleep quality has improved exponentially since. Bluetooth, WiFi, mobile data, and even old FM/AM radio waves all damage the cells of your body. This isn't a wacky conspiracy theory. But just like anything which we admit in life can cause us harm (fast food, gambling, drugs) we don't eradicate them from our lives we just learn to expose ourselves less to the toxicity. \n\nI recommend to anyone reading, tonight turn off every device in your home. Phones, WiFi routers, TVs, radios and see exactly how much your sleep can improve.", "created_utc": 1587240353.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fntf1uo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "parent_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fntf1uo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/g3n9zq/no_5g_does_not_spread_coronavirus/fntf1uo/"}
