Look up.  See that big bright thing in the sky?  Yeah, that's the sun.  And that thing is a massive nuclear fusion reaction that is thousands of times larger than the Earth.  That thing is basically an EM bomb.  This is why you need sunscreen.  The power reaching your skin from that thing is many orders of magnitude stronger than any wireless technology.  Oh, and it puts out all frequencies.  From radio waves to gamma waves.  A lot of the higher frequency shit gets filtered on the atmosphere, but some makes it through from time to time.  Yeah, keep wearing that sunscreen.  \n\nPeople are silly.  There's no magic in EMR.  It's been studied to death.  I mean, if you want, you could try and resurrect (or clone) Nikola Tesla, he couldve given you the lowdown over 100 years ago. But, no, let's blame companies because they are evil or something.
