We see so much misinformation these days; It's not unreasonable to ask for more hard evidence and proof when all we're getting in the news is outrage.\n\n>Therefore, censoring idiotic discussions about technology among  unqualified lay persons on social media is justifiable...\n\n*This time* it's an idiotic discussion they're censoring, but it's setting a precedent. What if the next time it's something legitimate? We won't know because it'll be written off and silenced so quickly, we'll never see it.\n\nIf someone is actually encouraging this behavior, that's incitement, and they can be charged for it, but if we start this game of censoring theories (no matter how crazy) because they're dangerous, that can very quickly take us down a road no one wants to travel.\n\nWhat happens if sometime in the future, we do find something about 5G? It's highly unlikely, but we're constantly discovering new side effects to our existing technology. What happens then when the communications companies want to keep it silent, and we've already endorsed the idea that we can't criticize it?\n\n>...if it keeps  segments of the public from destroying public property.\n\nAnd again, we have a bunch of claims that the 5G Corona conspiracies are the cause but not a lot of hard facts. I won't say that people are above being that scared and stupid. The stupid conspiracy is *probably* the cause, but I'd really like to see some *actual* evidence, not just the word of some company spokesperson. Call me cynical or paranoid if you must, but we're living in some unsure times.", "created_utc": 1587051390.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnld1a8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnlawu7", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnld1a8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnld1a8/"}
