I've worked in IT my whole life. Ive seen it evolve since around 90s. It has enabled people to be fucking stupid - together.\n\nBefore, these people would just have these dumb thoughts, put a gun in their mouth , chicken out and then eat a TV dinner. Now they all gather and bounce their stupid fucking ideas off each other in a swirling tornado of misinformation.\n\nThe reality is, most of these people feel worthless and this crazy shit gives them meaning - and keeps a gun out of their own mouths. Kind of like religion. :3\n\nOur lives have become so awesome, easy and automated - you can be borderline brain dead and get by just fine. There has also been a movement of glorifying stupidity over the past few decades but that's another rant for another day.", "created_utc": 1588892827.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptk9v0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt30te", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1588893007.0, "name": "t1_fptk9v0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptk9v0/"}
