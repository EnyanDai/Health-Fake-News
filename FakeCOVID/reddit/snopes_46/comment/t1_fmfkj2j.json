It's nothing more than a radio transmitting a modulated signal, something which we've been doing for well over 100 years. Things like safe exposure limits were worked out decades ago.\n\n> Edit 2: most of you guys are unpleasant so I\u2019m not going to put in the effort to find articles I\u2019ve read over the months.\n\nI don't need to find articles written by people whose sole exposure to radio communcations is listening to it in the car on the way home, watching TV, using a mobile phone and their home wifi. I've had radio communications as a serious hobby for many years and a licence that allows me to not only receive but build my own kit and transmit on all the frequency ranges that 5G will use. Not only that, as it is a legal requirement that I comply with regulations in regards to safety I know how to calculate whether the signals I transmit are safe for people near my antennas too.", "created_utc": 1586029168.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmfkj2j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_furdeu", "parent_id": "t1_fmecgzz", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586029574.0, "name": "t1_fmfkj2j", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/furdeu/masts_set_on_fire_over_false_5g_coronavirus_claims/fmfkj2j/"}
