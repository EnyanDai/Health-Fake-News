It isn't just about the speakers right to speak, but also the listeners right to listen. I don't know about you, but I have no problem being confronted by crazy or wildly outlandish claims, because at the very least it forces me to reexamine what I know, how I know it, and how that information disproves what the crazy speaker is saying.\n\nAnd before someone chimes in to inform me that the first amendment doesn't apply - the concept of freedom of speech/expression likely pre-date the US constitution by a couple thousand years (ancient Greece being a notable example). Just because the first amendment doesn't apply to this situation doesn't mean we should be okay with multi-billion dollar social media companies who control the platforms where more and more of our interactions take place playing arbiters of truth.", "created_utc": 1586177372.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fml35iw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmkzfad", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fml35iw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fml35iw/"}
