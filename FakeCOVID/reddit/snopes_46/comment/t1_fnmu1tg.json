It\u2019s literally a generational issue. I fucking despise Facebook and it\u2019s a bunch of bullshit. I\u2019m also the owner of a modest business in my state so I can\u2019t do/say anything on FB these days, I worry some asshat would just come and sabotage the beautiful online reputation I\u2019ve built so, I hold my peace, go on there to creep on past friends to see where there are now it\u2019s really just a place for idiots to feel comfortable. The entire time I\u2019m on I\u2019m just like fuck man these people do not give a SHIT about their reputation these days. \n\nThe second part is that even now at family gatherings all of my boomer family members are just sitting on Facebook. It\u2019s so odd, me as a recent college graduate and my cousins who are all similar in age aren\u2019t on our phone at all and we\u2019re actually talking to each other in shock that all of the \u201cadults\u201d are sitting on their phones thinking their the news outlet and the voice of reason to all of their idiot friends who have football players as their Facebook profile picture. \n\nMy dad for instance thinks he\u2019s like the whistleblower of his community. Whatever he says on FB is the gospel and he thinks he\u2019s the one that should be sharing bullshit news to people and they are all like OMG THANK YOU. \n\nExample: a brown paper bag in the road, don\u2019t stop for it it\u2019s a trick that car thieves use so you can get carjacked. Like come the fuck on, do you REALLY think this is a thing? My dad shares it, 100\u2019s of comments from local friends saying OMG thanks SHARED! Idiots feeding idiots. \n\nRant over, this is a summary of why I came to reddit.", "created_utc": 1587078161.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnmu1tg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnmmfks", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnmu1tg", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnmu1tg/"}
