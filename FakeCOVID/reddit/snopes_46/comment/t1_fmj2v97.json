In an ideal world, yes, both the general public and healthcare workers would have enough masks. However since there is a rationing of masks, healthcare workers who experience the most direct exposure to the Covid-19  individuals deserve to be protected. As for masks, I'm talking about N95s and N95 respirators, among other masks. I am not talking about surgical masks or DIY masks, I believe everyone should be wearing them.\n\nIf healthcare workers start getting infected, they will be spreading coronavirus like wildfire to every patient. If they get sick and they have to quarantine themselves then you are paralyzing the healthcare system. If healthcare workers start quarantining and dying off, then you will without a doubt have a tremendous increase in the death rate. So yes, you do want to \"save masks for doctors\". Its in society's benefit. You don't want the people capable of saving your grandma's live to be the first ones dying.\n\n\nOnce again it sucks that there is a shortage but in a time like this a doctor dealing with 40+ sick patients a day deserves that mask more than Karen hoarding all the N95s for the unforeseeable future.", "created_utc": 1586121921.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj2v97", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmihmfz", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj2v97", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmj2v97/"}
