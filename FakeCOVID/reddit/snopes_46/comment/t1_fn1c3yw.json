I'm in no way claiming that China isn't a fascist state. I'm claiming that all real communist states are. The idea of communism is a myth. \n\n> China has far more in common with Nazi Germany than it does with any socialist country.\n\n100% agree, and kind of my point. Nazi Germany was also \"communist.\" \n\n> Under socialism, private wealth is deplored. Under fascism, billionaires are totally acceptable - so long as they use their fortunes to fulfill the state agenda.\n\nNeither of these are true or even relevant. These are false comparisons, which you're using to insinuate an appeal. This is the wrong way to reason. And if you're falling for statements like this you should rethink your approach. \n\n> The danger with seeing China as Communist is that it fails to recognize how private corporations can work hand-in-hand to advance a fascist agenda\n\nWhich the Chinese government itself does. That's the whole reason why communism corrupts, and why private interests and matters of the state must remain separate. Private ownership isn't about greed. It's about distributing the concentration of power so that IF a corrupt businessman or politician rises to power, they can't screw both sides over.", "created_utc": 1586558953.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn1c3yw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fn19odn", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn1c3yw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fn1c3yw/"}
