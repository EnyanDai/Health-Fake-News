Subsection (c) speaks to the \u201cgood samaritan\u201d permissions given to a \u201cprovider.\u201d Being the arbiter of truth is not listed in (c)(2). Nor is any other phrase soeaking to viewpoint. In fact, it\u2019s the \u201clewd\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d material that they can \u201cmoderate.\u201d And then go read common law cases regarding publishers versus platforms.\n\nIt\u2019s simply an inquiry into whether they are moderating or editing. Moderation speaks to the content in (c)(2). Editing speaks to removing viewpoints or, as we saw with Facebook and Google in 2016 election, using their algorithms to push specific viewpoints, or at least ostensibly doing so or having the power to do so with plausible deniability. To the last point, go watch \u201cThe Creepy Line.\u201d \n\nAgain, not going to wite you a law review article. I\u2019m simply putting this out there for others to look into. Plain and simple, this isn\u2019t a first amendment issue. It would, however, become one, if it were deemed that these mega-platforms were essentially an extension of the state.
