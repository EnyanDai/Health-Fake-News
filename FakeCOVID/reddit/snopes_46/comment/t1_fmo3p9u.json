Not whether or not there is absolutely no effect on the human body. That being said, the waves used in 5g communication make use of radio waves at a frequency that is known to be either minimally or not at all impactful on human health. Life expectancy has risen since the invention of the cell phone, so I guess there\u2019s that. I was the one who asked for proof which you provided none of. Ever consider the reason there hasn\u2019t been a link established between 5g and health is because there is no basis to search for one?\n\nWhat I\u2019m tired of is people assuming that since there is no counter information something must be true. There is no study proving Reddit doesn\u2019t cause cancer! So reddit must cause cancer! See how baseless that is? \n\nNow try to understand, radio waves are well understood as well as their impact on the human body. The human body is well understood as is it\u2019s interaction with various forms of radiation including radio waves. So, since nobody who uses 5g has suddenly gotten cancer or died as a result it hasn\u2019t been studied.Similarly, people who study either the human body or radio waves and their interactions have clearly not discovered any major issues. \n\nNow there is a real problem here, the corona virus, and people are ignoring it to try and place blame on 5g cell signals? What the hell! Devote all that worry about 5g to worry about an ACTUAL FUCKING PANDEMIC and maybe we can start to stem the real causes of it spreading.
