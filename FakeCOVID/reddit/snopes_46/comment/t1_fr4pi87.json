Skeptical and critical thinking are critical skills that take conscious and deliberate effort to execute. \n\nWe get in to trouble when we start assuming that only other people are conspiratorially minded or that that group is a small group of people. When we communicate science to the public we have to be cognizant of the fact that likely everyone has at least one unjustifiable belief that they walk around with everyday. \n\nTo continue the conversation, [work from Alin Coman](https://wws.princeton.edu/faculty-research/research/item/dark-side-meaning-making-how-social-exclusion-leads-superstitious) suggests that the more marginalized people feel, the more driven they are to think conspiratorially. I wonder if the flames of conspiracy thinking are being fanned by the isolation people feel with various levels of quarantine. Also, as another post pointed out, some people just like being contrarian. You can\u2019t crack open someone\u2019s skull and point to their beliefs, you can only identify what they endorse.
