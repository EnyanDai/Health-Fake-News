Large-scale adoption began in 2019 and today virtually every telecommunication service provider in the developed world is upgrading its infrastructure to offer 5G functionality. 5G communication requires the use of communications devices (mostly mobile phones) designed to support the technology.\n\nThe frequency spectrum of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band, and low-band.\n\n***\n\n**Concerns over Chinese involvement in 5G wireless networks**\n\nConcerns over Chinese involvement in 5G wireless networks stem from allegations that cellular network equipment sourced from Chinese vendors may contain backdoors enabling surveillance by the Chinese government (as part of its intelligence activity internationally) and Chinese laws, such as the China Internet Security Law, which compel companies and individuals to assist the state intelligence agency on the collection of information whenever requested. The allegations came against the backdrop of the rising prominence of Chinese telecommunication vendors Huawei and ZTE in the 5G equipment market, and the controversy has led to other countries debating whether Chinese vendors should be allowed to participate in 5G deployments; Australia formally barred Chinese companies from providing its 5G equipment due to security concerns, while Japan has heavily discouraged use of Chinese equipment.\n\n***\n\n^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)", "created_utc": 1586607301.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn2xy7j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyszf4", "parent_id": "t1_fn2xy1b", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn2xy7j", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fyszf4/5g_is_not_linked_to_the_coronavirus_pandemic_in/fn2xy7j/"}
