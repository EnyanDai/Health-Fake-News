So rather than admit that Bill Gates has been raising valid concerns for years, these people find it easier to invent a story about how Gates manufactured this virus to prove himself right.\n\nGates blog 2010:\n\n>But the real story isn\u2019t how bad H1N1 was. The real story is that we are lucky it wasn\u2019t worse because we were almost completely unprepared for it....We did a reasonable job of gathering data, partly due to the capacity that had been set up to track avian flu. But for all the other steps, we didn\u2019t manage to do anything that would have stopped a serious epidemic. In other words, the modest death toll from this flu epidemic is entirely because we were lucky.\n\nThe title of Bill Gates' TED talk in 2015:\n\n>The next outbreak? We're not ready\n\nBill Gates in 2018:\n\n>The president was kind enough to spend time with me, and one of the issues I brought up is this opportunity to build new tools that would help us deal with a pandemic.... It is strange that this risk, that the world isn\u2019t doing more. We talk about doing more when we have smaller epidemics like Ebola and Zika, but then the actual follow-up is pretty modest. We think the idea of spending what would be a tiny part of the budget to be ready for a pandemic makes sense.\n\nSo if you're a Trump fan and you read this, you *could* acknowledge that Trump made a mistake by not heeding Bill Gates' warnings. Or you could just never admit that you were ever wrong and that the coronavirus is a conspiracy to make Trump look bad", "created_utc": 1588903074.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpu26j1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpu182t", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpu26j1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpu26j1/"}
