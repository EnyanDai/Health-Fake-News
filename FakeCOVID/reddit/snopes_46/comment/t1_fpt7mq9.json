I'd rather take my chances with a parachute, even if I wasn't trained, than to burn to death, or maybe it could be mandatory to have a helicopter standing by on-site that could rescue anyone stuck up there in the event of an emergency. Also, unless you're like a coal or natural gas magnate, why would you be against clean power? As long as the grid has enough excess capacity to not have rolling blackouts then why would you give a shit if it's powered by unicorn farts? Surely renewables will eventually be less expensive than fossil fuels since all you'd have to worry about is maintenance & not the cost of the fuel itself.", "created_utc": 1588886287.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpt7mq9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpslzxx", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpt7mq9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpt7mq9/"}
