Where it is becoming weirdly common. It comes from a religious thought via the left behind series, like a memetic thought pattern in the religious conservatives. \n\nEssentially: in the X files, there's some stuff about shots and implants, and in the Left Behind series, the \"Mark of the Beast\" is an implant that demonstrates citizenship in a global government led by satanic forces. These ideas in fiction have mutated into real world conspiracy theories that the government covertly implants people with the mark of the beast, and that this is the work of a globalist cabal of satanists led by the Club of Rome. \n\nThey neglect to notice that this \"Club of Rome\" is just one of several such clubs, or that it would be impossible for such a conspiracy to be kept by the truly massive number of ordinary people including ... Pharmacists... That distribute flu shots.
