I always had a crappy phone, never used it for much other than reddit and reading online sites. Got an unlocked S9 2 years ago and my data usage went way up. The first time I hit the cap on the \"unlimited\" plan and got bumped down... my phone was unusable for the rest of the month. To read one article, I'd basically have to click it, then just leave my phone on the table for the next 3 minutes while it loaded (that was with the Straight Talk normal \"unlimited\" plan). One time with that and I started paying the extra 10 bucks to get actual unlimited data. Now I dont even bother connecting to the wifi at work. I dont have or need cable or internet at home (over the air TV is fine, I have an easy job and just update my playstation at work, download new Switch games at work. And I'm not actually home that often to care about having a $100+ cable & internet plan), my phone is just fine. I have Hulu, HBOgo, Netflix etc on my phone and watch entire seasons only using mobile data. Havent had my phone ever slow down since switching to the $55 plan. So if you actually get slowed down often enough, it's worth looking into their unlimited plan. It's pretty nice not having to keep track of my data", "created_utc": 1587255138.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnu5u3i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntsn2m", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnu5u3i", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnu5u3i/"}
