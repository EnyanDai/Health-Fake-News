Do you feel like you're being cooked alive?  Are you sweating all the time?  Are you getting strange sun-burn-like burns?  No?  Then you're completely fine.  The amount your body temperature will increase by due to the higher frequencies that 5G will transmit on is incredibly incredibly far from being at a level where you could even notice it at all.  You are orders of magnitude away from being exposed to dangerous levels of non-ionizing radiation that would cook you alive because obviously no one wants that and safety regulations play it way safe because it's easy to do so. \n\nIt's non-ionizing radiation, meaning there literally isn't enough energy in the wave to break electron bonds and ionize molecules in your DNA to cause cancer.  It's physically impossible.  There is just not enough gas in the tank.  It's been decades and decades, people have been trying to link non-ionizing radiation to cancer for a long time and it just isn't the case.\n\n5G is not going to transmit at 300GHz, and even if it did, that is once again, still way less than visible light, the stuff you know is fine.  It's still non-ionizing and a long way from ionizing levels.\n\nThe fact that they need more towers for 5G because the signal is so easily blocked should tell you that these waves are not very powerful and won't do you harm.", "created_utc": 1587281165.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnv5qem", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnu7ze0", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnv5qem", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnv5qem/"}
