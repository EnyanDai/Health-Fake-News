I mean most people are well aware that company\u2019s take advantage of workers and when you look at places like the US where you either die in hospital or leave it being in debt bondage for the rest of your life it\u2019s very easy to start going down a rabbit hole. Most people close their eyes to it all and they\u2019re just as bad. Reality is the middle grey ground, no ufos are kicking around and the world isn\u2019t flat and yes there has being some vaccine fuck ups but testing has got better through the ages. But there is still rich evil people out there that bend the law and worm around it like snakes to try and get as much capital gain as possible. It\u2019s just easy to fall down a hole with this stuff and end up going to far. There\u2019s just a balance between wanting a home with the girl you love and wanting a quiet life and seeing that your just a number on a sheet to some very rich people who sell your data to the highest bidder, try to exploits as much out of you and keep you in debt so you have no choice but work for them in their system.
