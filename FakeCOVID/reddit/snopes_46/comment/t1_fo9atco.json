She has never said to use essential oils as medication. She only says they help relax her. And truthfully, she's not huge on essential oils or crystals; I've hardly seen her mention those things. She's mostly into astrology.\n\n> None of what you're saying means it isn't possible that she's in a bubble similar to the one Tati is in. \n\nThe...*proof* I mentioned that she doesn't live in a Tati-esq bubble...means nothing? Telling you that Kathleen believes in science...means nothing?\n\n> Just because you think someone is a nice person doesn't mean they're immune from criticism either\n\nJust because someone is into things you're not (astrology, crystals) for spirital and/or aesthetic reasons doesn't mean you get to suddenly criticize them for things they've never done.", "created_utc": 1587614622.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo9atco", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g6afbr", "parent_id": "t1_fo99plm", "score": -14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3jayp", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo9atco", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/g6afbr/tati_posts_about_5g_during_a_time_of/fo9atco/"}
