I don't know if you meant to use \"prejucide\", but holy moly that should be the word for institutionalized racism from cradle to grave.  You should absolutely submit that to Merriam-Webster.  I applaud your use of this word.\n\n2. I 100% agree with everything you said, and I'll add to it - we're still shaking the primal bonds of our tribalism, and the best evidence we have of that is the internet revealing that we hadn't really even begun to do that; everything we built on top of that in the name of civilization was done with regard to the need to remain tribal for survival's sake.  We don't need that part of our species anymore - we *all* actually have the ability to just get along, but we *choose* not to; giving in to our primal tribal inclinations.  Australopithecus could potentially be 4.2 million years old, meaning tribes have been around *at least* since then when you consider primates have been around longer than that, and every bit of prehistoric primate evidence heavily suggests that tribalism isn't a prehistoric human institution, they already had it.  So we've got potentially tens of millions of years worth of tribalism hard-wired into our genetic code.  We only cracked that genetic code a couple of years ago.  We've got a *long* road to hoe.  We may not make it to the end of that road before destroying ourselves.", "created_utc": 1586255302.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmodss4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmn7l81", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmodss4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmodss4/"}
