Also in multiple languages to confirm world view. I speak 3 languages and sort of scan-read another 2 so I try to verify and look for stories in every language as best as I can.\n\nAlso, opinion pieces are trash in all newspapers, often very warped with questionable things in them.\n\nFT, WSJ is pretty good for economic and financial stuff but they are a bit hazy on the details in Asia.\n\nThe Economist and Bloomberg are more out there with their clickbaity things and some inaccurate reporting but they sometimes have some really good stuff.\n\nThe Diplomat is nice for a view of US-associated political thinktanks about Asia.\n\nGuardian is pretty good for the general gist but not the details.
