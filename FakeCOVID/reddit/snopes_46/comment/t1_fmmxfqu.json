Well, I've been perfectly fine without one. And there's a correlation between me hearing about 5G appearing and me being scared about COVID-19!\n\n &nbsp;\n\nLet's be honest, a majority of people (certainly including myself) are fully able to take our preference for convenience and ease, our ability to make hasty judgements based on cognitive biases, and a preference for going along with a big angry group with pitchforks to the lengths that we prefer these platitudes over 'hard scientific evidence'.  \nHow often does 'hard scientific evidence' make me *feel good*?
