Have they had a lot of 5G in China?\n\nWhat about all the places in the countries where there are sick people that don't have 5G yet?\n\nAll this aside, why on earth would the same companies that build these towers want throngs of people to get sick and die? Wouldn't they rather those people want to get 5G and pay them money?\n\nLike I just feel at this point like it's a Putin disinformation campaign joke, like the Russians are sitting there like, \"I don't know, tell them something stupid like... The cell phone towers cause diseases. ....Oh my god they actually believe it, LMAO!\"\n\nLike it's just completely idiotic as soon as you look at it for more than 5 seconds.", "created_utc": 1587243037.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fntjqbp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t3_g3mgns", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587243508.0, "name": "t1_fntjqbp", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fntjqbp/"}
