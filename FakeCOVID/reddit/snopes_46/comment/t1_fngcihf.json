That's just how the media painted it to make it look crazy. Pizzagate was about the connections between the very creepy owner of that pizza shop and DC elites. Epstein, the Podesta's, Weiner, the Clinton's! It's all connected. \n\nYou know that the guy that \"shot the place up\" fired one single bullet, hitting and potentially destroying the computer. That's it. What are the odds?? There is a lot of very suspect stuff about James Alefantis... Have you seen his instagram?\n\nEdit: And why/how was a pizza parlor owner on GQs top 50 list of most powerful people in Washington?? The media wasn't exactly honest about Epstein. Or Weinstein for that matter..\n\nOh, and the hillary emails. I'm not saying that \"pizza\" and other foods were code for pedophilia. But it was code for something. People don't talk the way they were in those emails, and they don't talk about the same 5 foods all the time.", "created_utc": 1586928122.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngcihf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnfwdm3", "score": -20, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586928829.0, "name": "t1_fngcihf", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngcihf/"}
