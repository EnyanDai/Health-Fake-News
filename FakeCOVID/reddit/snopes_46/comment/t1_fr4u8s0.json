They dislike/hate the idea that maybe the world is chaotic and there are things out of your hands or everyone else's hands and you can't control it. They want to believe that there is something, or someone, in control over everything and that there is some greater reason than just a virus having a stroll across the world. \n\nPeople who grab on to conspiracy theories are quick to grab on to something, that for them, makes sense and helps make the world less chaotic. If you can accept one theory, it is a lot easier to start convincing them to accept other theories until eventually, all they believe is that there are people out to get them and that the world is controlled by the lizard shadow government - that's why they could never catch a break.
