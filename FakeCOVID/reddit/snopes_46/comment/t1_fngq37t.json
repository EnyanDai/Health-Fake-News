Youre right and its the reason i still use reddit. Its pretty easy to know a subs bias just from a couple posts. Wayyyy to many bot posts and bot comments on the front page but. Ppl know the front page is cancer anyway. Anyone thats used the site for over a years knows that you need to find your niche subs relevant to your interests. Ive seen my ex parnters use insta, fb, snap and twitter. So i know what the social media giants are like. \n\nHonestly i think most people love to have discussion and civil debate around controversial or conflicting topics but all of social giants suppress that type of conversation. Ive spent a lot of my twenties studying history and all western social media seems to be creating a single hivemind of the western world. This exact thing is what happens to places before a crisis occurs and and different ideology or power regime takes over. I guess though.. people in history never were able to communicate with so many others and instantaneously like we do today. \n\nBonus: though a little right leaning r/politicalcompassmemes have some decent discussion like you described.", "created_utc": 1586940772.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngq37t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1gtim", "parent_id": "t1_fngoxl2", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngq37t", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/australia/comments/g1gtim/5g_and_antivax_conspiracy_theorists_are/fngq37t/"}
