Nothing in specific, but you can link it to anything. For example in this case: \"Oh look at those crazy 5G conspiracy theorists, they probably think the world is flat as well\"\n\nHere they have connected the word 5G with \"conspiracy theorists\" and then that term is connected (in the minds of the gullible public) with the \"flat Earth\" concept and movement. To people that aren't paying attention its ultimately all one and the same thing. And trust me, people are not paying attention.\n\n They just casually link these things in people's minds.\n\n A similar unwarranted connection that I've seen pretty much everywhere is between the term \"conspiracy\" and \"conspiracy theory\", which is then connected to terms like \"flat Earth\" and just the idea of bullshit and insanity in general. A conspiracy theory is of course not the same as a conspiracy fact, but I've seen plenty of people say, when talking about actual conspiracies: \"Well this isn't even a conspiracy, but... /*insert referencing why a conspiracy is actually true* \". \n\nSo they already have the words conspiracy and bullshit connected in their minds. Obviously the term conspiracy simply means \"a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful\", which is happening all the time and has been throughout history. But people nowadays think that anything that is a conspiracy is simply bullshit! That's how far we've come. The term conspiracy is emotionally connected to inherent falseness.", "created_utc": 1586632676.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn42ep6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fz7g4z", "parent_id": "t1_fn3o337", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_37lis", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn42ep6", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/C_S_T/comments/fz7g4z/i_hate_this_stupid_5g_causes_coronavirus/fn42ep6/"}
