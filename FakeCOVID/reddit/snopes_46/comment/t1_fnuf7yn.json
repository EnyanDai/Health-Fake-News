How early did y\u2019all get a dx and into early intervention? My son was speech delayed until K5. Right before it was time to move up, he opened up. He went from talking to fully nonverbal after a high fever and mild symptoms of rubella after did MMR. I\u2019m not an antivaxxer; and he\u2019s up to date on all but that one because of the reaction. Just be patient. She will open up as much as she can with time. And with work. Unfortunately it\u2019s a tiresome and full time job. Talk talk talk. That is the best advice I got throughout the therapy. Talk through everything you do around her. You know, they tested him for autism at 2.5 after that 18 mo shot for hearing loss. My pediatrician didn\u2019t want to go any other route, was convinced it was his hearing. \ud83d\ude44 I wasn\u2019t out of nursing school 6 months at the time and was LIVID she was tryin to avoid documenting is vaccine injury, and delayed on the testing for speech. Such is life. Nearly 10 years later, he has a small issue with \u201cs\u201d and \u201cth\u201d but he\u2019s always been honor roll and in inclusion or regular (private school) classes. Best of luck!
