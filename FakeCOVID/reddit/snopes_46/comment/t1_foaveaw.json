Her content has been less than entertaining or helpful. Yesterday she posted a bunch of symptoms she's been having and what it could be. Many people chimed in that it sounded like anxiety or physical effects of being indoors for long (she was one of the first to start isolating), and I know my doctor gave me a heads up as to symptoms I could experience and they included many of the ones she named. \nShe kept telling people they were wrong, so I was like just ask your doctor then?? And she said she already had. But like, then why post it and ask for opinions only to tell people they're wrong?? \n\nThis situation has shown me how self absorbed and totally clueless she is. She boasted how she was one of the first to pay attention to the situation in China and she tried to accelerate the manufacture of vitamins to profit off this, she basically said \"I told you so!\" to all the people that asked her to stop fear mongering, and kept talking about how much of an inconvenience it is then deleted the tweets. Definitely lost a follower, sub, and customer in me.
