If you think the case is closed why would your brain continue to work on the case?\n\nThe above commenter seems unfamiliar with Alex Jones and brought up a recycled story from 8 years ago.

That just means I\u2019m using an extra source you guys aren\u2019t aware of what exactly is being said on a daily basis.\n\n#biggest factor YouTube banned the video about 5G with David Icke on the LondonReel.
