Guess what they're called...\n\nTell you what, here is the link: [Wikipedia - Millimeter Wave Scanner.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimeter_wave_scanner) In those you literally stand in a box and are blasted with mmWave radiation, and injuries or coronavirus don't occur from that. It's probably chosen *because* it's non-ionising and cannot penetrate the skin more than a millimeter or so.\n\nIn addition, many cars have a mmWave radar fitted to the front these days to automatically apply the brakes if they're approaching something at speed. Police radar guns also use the mmWave band.\n\nYes, it's a relatively new frequency for use in consumer communications except WiGig that never really took off. However its been in use in many many other applications for a very long time. There is plenty of research.
