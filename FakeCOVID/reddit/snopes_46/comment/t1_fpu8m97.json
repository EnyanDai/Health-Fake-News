You responded in an opposing manner, even going so far as to, without any reason, jump to the opposite extreme and rhetorically ask if we should instead be coddling them. It's incredibly apparent that you don't respect these people, which is your prerogative. You very clearly stated that you don't empathize with them.\n\nBut to answer in the way you did, arguing against the sentiment of a person who's point was \"don't be a dick,\" makes you seem like you're someone who thinks it's permissible to be a dick to these people because you don't empathize with them. Otherwise why would you have responded the way you did?\n\nYou're right you don't have to be a dick. That's a start. I'll go even further and say you shouldn't be a dick regardless of how you feel about them.\n\nAnd nobody said it's your responsibility to engage these people. I'm saying it's *not* your responsibility to engage these people if you don't want to have an honest discussion. My point is literally: Unless you are prepared to debate these people from a position of good intentions, don't even bother saying anything because you won't do any good.", "created_utc": 1588907059.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpu8m97", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptsfht", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpu8m97", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpu8m97/"}
