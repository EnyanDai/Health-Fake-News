One of the biggest causes might be airpollution. Wuhan and North-Italy are both very polluted. (edit: maybe also 5G, but I'm still very very skeptical about that)\n\nVery Interesting things asre Extracellular Vesicles(exosomes). They are little things that cells use for communication, removing waste and toxics, etc. \nSome of them are basically indistinguishable from viruses. Same structure, made same way, reacts sane receptors etc. Some of them carries RNA just like viruses. \n\nPCR tests don't not test for virus. They test for RNA that are assumed to belong to the virus. What if COVID-19 isn't virus? What if it is example an Extracellular Vesicle that removes pollution from lung cells?\n\nI'm not saying that that is true, but at moment there isn't anything that could prove that wrong. \n\nIf it is  SARS-COV-2 virus that kills people, why the hell it kills in some places lot of people and in other places almost none? \n\nIf someone is interested to know more, here is great video: \nhttps://youtu.be/GWRbIIaPV78", "created_utc": 1586358440.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmsmpns", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t1_fms9rwl", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmsmpns", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmsmpns/"}
