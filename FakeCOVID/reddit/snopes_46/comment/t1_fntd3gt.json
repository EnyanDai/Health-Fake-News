It had a section for party supplies. Things like colorful plates, whistles and confetti. I walked through it and was happy. I was attracted to all of it, but couldn't understand why. These weren't toys...these products were actually kinda boring. So why did I want them?\n\nMost people know how easily children are manipulated, however, studying psychology also made me understand how easily adults can be manipulated. We are born vulnerable to all sorts of fallacies. \n\nA Spanish friend called commercials \"propaganda\", because that is what his dictionary translated the word to.

Courses like, Theory of Knowledge, philosophy of science, Statistics, history of psychology...But I still find myself fall for it. \n\nHuman logic and perception is flawed.", "created_utc": 1587239245.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fntd3gt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fns43a0", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fntd3gt", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fntd3gt/"}
