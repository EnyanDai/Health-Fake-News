The reasoning is based in epistemology. Absolute truths don't exist, but absolute falsehoods do. It's impossible to gather enough evidence to prove an hypothesis, but it only takes one piece of evidence to disprove a hypothesis.\n\nTake the famous example hypothesis, all ravens are black. What measures would we have to take in order to prove this statement? Well, the obvious experiment is to begin observing as many black ravens as possible. How many black ravens must we observe to say this hypothesis is absolutely true. Well, we can start by observing every raven on Earth. If they are all black in color, then may be we can be confident that all ravens are black; but what if there are ravens on another planet halfway across the universe? How can we observe these ravens light years away, and are these the only other place in the universe where ravens exist? I don't know. So scientists opt for the much easier experiment, which is to look for one raven that is not black in color. If we find one raven that is, say, green or blue. Then we have absolutely disproven the hypothesis, and, as a result, made a more powerful statement about our universe.", "created_utc": 1588909594.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpucint", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpu93vg", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpucint", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpucint/"}
