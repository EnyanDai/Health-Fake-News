So technically, only one of the last five major pandemics started in China.\n\nAnd straight-up lying about the utilities providers in HK, and lowkey implying HK belongs to China:\n\n>Hong Kong is considered a SAR and their government have free hands except for energy supply, water supply, military and foreign policy. It belongs to China but is not integrated with China.\n\nThose are straight up lies from the CCP and he only believes in the Chinese side of the story. What\u2019s more crazy is that he keeps telling people that he\u2019s born and raised in Sweden, trying to make himself sound more unbiased and rational. Very typical, and yet, very effective at misleading the public.", "created_utc": 1586548259.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn0t6cw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fn0sjv9", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586548650.0, "name": "t1_fn0t6cw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fn0t6cw/"}
