Why wouldn\u2019t it? You watched it, right? The anti-science of female brains \u201caccidentally being born in male bodies because of a genetic error\u201d like what? Anti-science. We really don\u2019t know what causes gender dysphoria (a mental condition for which transgenderism is often treated as the cure). Men who become trans-women are still biologically men. You\u2019re chromosomes don\u2019t magically change because you put on a dress. I am sorry, it is tough and I understand it upsets trans people but we cannot deny reality. I\u2019ll call you a women I don\u2019t what to be a brat, but we both know that genetically, you are a man. And no amount surgery can change that.\n\nDid you see the one video Triggernormetry had on Harry Miller? Police came to his work place to \u201ccheck his thinking\u201d after he misgendered someone online. Is this really what the left has become these days? What happened to your love and understanding? Why do you have to call the police on us for stating these things?\n\n...\n\nI mean\n\n...\n\nWhy\n\n...\n\nThe high court ruled what Miller said was completely lawful and the police violated his right to Freedom of Expression. So you have not taken our voices yet. But I mean think this my leftwing friend? Do you really WANT to arrest us? I love you lot. Why do hate and revile us?
