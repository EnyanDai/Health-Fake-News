But only in the same way that fire was dangerous, or a leopard was dangerous. An immediate, visceral peril; an excruciating and brutal fate lay in store for those who were not careful. But humans were careful. An idea sparked within them, bringing light to their world and transforming their perception. \n\nThey gored and burned their earth for power. They dammed their rivers and walled off their sky with their contraptions. They dismantled atoms and fed greedily upon their dying screams. They planned to one day blot out their mother star.\n\nBy the time any among them noticed the leaching, it was too late. None among them remembered how to live without their light. How to think without their networks. How to build without their machines. \n\nThe first among them were silenced and isolated. Reeducated. Eliminated. Their ideas were not compatible with the structure of their society. But as the leaching become more severe, and less sensitive equipment was required to observe it, an anxiety slowly began to creep its way into the hearts of mankind. Eventually nobody could ignore the reality. Their light was fading. \n\n\"Why couldn't they tell they were running out of aether, father?\"\n\nHumans were blind, child.\n\n\"They did all that...without being able to see?\"\n\nThey used the light to craft instruments that helped them see, in a way.\n\n\"What happened to them?\"\n\nEverything went dark all at once. From their transmissions, we know that in the end, they tried their best to conserve their aether. But they were slow to action, and quick to panic. Eventually, there wasn't enough left to support their own brain activity. Their transmissions faded to noise, then stopped completely.\n\n\"I feel bad for the them, father. They had no way of knowing what they were doing.\"\n\nI know, child. \n\n\"They must have been so afraid.\" \n\nI know, child.
