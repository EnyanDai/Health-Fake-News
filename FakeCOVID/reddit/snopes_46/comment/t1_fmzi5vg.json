After many attempts to lay out the facts and question the simple holes in logic, I'm left with no other conclusion than such minds are immune to the truth. They just can't get smarter, they can't make the effort to educate themselves or check facts. Their standard reaction is hostility, calling people sheep and accusing any sceptic that they haven't fact checked or sat down with a pen and paper. If they were so enlightened they would be kind enough to share what they know. In the end I think this is a defence mechanism for their own paranoia, ignorance and inability to think. To them coincidence = causation and fudging the details to fit the theory is standard practice.", "created_utc": 1586521148.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmzi5vg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwkcwo", "parent_id": "t1_fmoplea", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmzi5vg", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwkcwo/youtube_tightens_rules_after_david_icke_5g/fmzi5vg/"}
