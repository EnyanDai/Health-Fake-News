I also have no interest in defending/attacking the US or China. I just want to probe the facts like anyone else cause this is interesting to me.\n\nThere are multiple labs and university campus locations in the area (like any typical city). The BSL4 lab (only one in China) is ~10 miles away across the river. An additional lab, is *meters* away across the street from the market. This address may or may not have changed because Google shows a different address closer to the river.\n\nBefore anyone loses their mind or having to link any website deemed *undesirable,* here's Washington Post making the claim:\n\n* [Did coronavirus accidentally escape from a Wuhan lab?

Those 2 things could exist simultaneously. To censor any and all independent research that goes against the establishment line is a really dangerous thing. We have already seen how tricky of a thing this is with regards to Syrian gas attacks. As well as Iraq WMD.
