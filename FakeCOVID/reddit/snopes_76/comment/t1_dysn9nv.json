Timothy Ziemer left the National Security Council (NSC) this week, and national security adviser John Bolton dissolved the global health security team that Ziemer oversaw.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Ziemer will not be replaced, and that his departure means that there is no single official at the highest levels of the administration who focuses only on global health security.\n\nNSC spokesman Robert Palladino told the Post that the Trump administration \u201cremains committed to global health, global health security and biodefense, and will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.\u201d\n\nZiemer\u2019s departure from the NSC is the latest since Bolton joined the administration last month. Four senior aides left or resigned under pressure from the council during Bolton\u2019s first week on the job.\n\nBolton has said he wants to restructure the NSC.\n\nTwo members of Ziemer\u2019s global health team are now working in a unit overseeing weapons of mass destruction and another joined a unit on international organizations, the Post reported.\n\nWhite House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, who called for a thorough strategy to combat pandemics, left the administration the day after Bolton starting serving in the post.", "created_utc": 1526014084.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "dysn9nv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8ijdmn", "parent_id": "t3_8ijdmn", "score": 37, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2zlwp", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_dysn9nv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/EverythingScience/comments/8ijdmn/top_white_house_official_in_charge_of_pandemic/dysn9nv/"}
