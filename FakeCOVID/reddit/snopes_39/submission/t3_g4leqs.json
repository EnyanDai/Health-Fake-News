They're there because of family prestige. (!!!)\n\nHe says that on a joint venture between America and France...he's having difficulty describing. I'm thinking he's trying to describe a space shuttle. [...] He says there will be a calamity. This ship will have some scientists on it doing some biological experiments to see how these take place beyond the pull of gravity. An accident will happen, a malfunction...\u201d\n\nI looked it up and in fact there\u2019s a joint NASA / France lunar mission scheduled for 2024. The ship is called Artemis. Mercury will be in Sagittarius on November 2nd 2024. \ud83d\ude10\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-20/france-hitches-a-ride-on-nasa-s-next-mission-to-the-moon\n\nVery dark of course but how uncanny!!! \n\n Just wanted to share as I just keep finding Dolores\u2019 books true to fact over and over and they are endlessly fascinating.", "stickied": false}
