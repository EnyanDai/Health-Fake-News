The U.S. speculation is that this came from a super bio lab just 3 miles away from the Wuhan animal market in China! See 4:06 of the linked Fox News interview on youtube.\n\nFull fox news interview with Senator Tom Cotton: [https://youtu.be/ytGIkcCh7T8](https://youtu.be/ytGIkcCh7T8)\n\nYou'll now see other news affiliates like CNN debunking this as a theory. Senator Cotton has white papers and affidavits from renowned top virologists in China.\n\n========================================================================\n\nPeople caught on camera spreading the virus by spitting on heavily used public utilities:\n\nAre these people just sickos? Or are they agents spreading the virus. Covid-19 is spreading quite rapidly in some places but not others. Considering the Chinese response with the lock down of 70 million people and pop up hospitals it is still spreading quite rapidly. The supply chain and panic affect on economics worldwide are astounding.\n\nThe timing of covid-19 and previous coronavirus releases coincide with the busiest movements of the year in China, such as celebrations of the new year.\n\nWe see a few things on camera, many more similar situations are most likely unfolding that weren't captured by hidden cameras or that made it to the internet under China's strict control over online content.

Investigators are looking into whistleblower death as a possible homicide cover up: [https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/07/803680463/china-to-investigate-after-whistleblower-doctor-dies-from-coronavirus](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/07/803680463/china-to-investigate-after-whistleblower-doctor-dies-from-coronavirus)\n\n========================================================================\n\nStop gap against civil unrest:\n\nSome also speculate this outbreak gave the communist government a way to stop recent political unrest, civil discourse and rioting. Quarantine allows them to quietly cart away anyone they wanted with impunity.

If a military wanted a practical real world test of the spread, the contingencies and actual response time, this would be the way to do it.
