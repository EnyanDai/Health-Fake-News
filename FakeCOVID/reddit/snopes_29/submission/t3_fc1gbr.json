The story is still developing and there is still no clarity on the details of the patient executed by North Korea.\n\n> Earlier last week, reports had suggested that a North Korean trade official was shot dead for leaving coronavirus quarantine to visit a public bath.\n\n> South Korea-based Daily North Korea citing inside sources reported that as many as five people had died of the novel coronavirus COVID 19 in the same city.\n\n> It is widely believed that it is the fear of the novel coronavirus that has also kept the North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, from appearing in public, who has not been seen since January-end.\n\n> WHO officials have claimed that the North Koreans have reached through back channels to ask for supplies such as disposable gowns, gloves, and hazmat suits raising fears that the country may have cases of COVID 19..\n\n\n*****\n[**Summary Source**](https://smmry.com/https://www.ibtimes.sg/north-koreas-first-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-patient-shot-dead-report-40042) | [FAQ](http://autotldr.io/ \"438780 summaries so far.\") | [Feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **North**^#1 **Korean**^#2 **Korea**^#3 **China**^#4 **coronavirus**^#5\n\nPost found in [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fc0ku9/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/Conservative](http://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/fbbxl4/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/brasilivre](http://np.reddit.com/r/brasilivre/comments/fbdqjd/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/conservatives](http://np.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/fbgbx5/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/Conservative](http://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/fbbxl4/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/POLITIC](http://np.reddit.com/r/POLITIC/comments/fbgnms/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/brasilivre](http://np.reddit.com/r/brasilivre/comments/fbddp5/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fbhzs8/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_patient/), [/r/news](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/fbhzdn/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/Conservative](http://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/fbbxl4/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/AnythingGoesNews](http://np.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesNews/comments/fbgt8h/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/Conservative](http://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/fbbxl4/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/AmericanPolitics](http://np.reddit.com/r/AmericanPolitics/comments/fbgt64/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/worldpolitics](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/fbc3bf/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/), [/r/nottheonion](http://np.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/fb5kod/north_koreas_first_coronavirus_patient_reportedly/), [/r/northkorea](http://np.reddit.com/r/northkorea/comments/far3ej/kim_jong_un_sanctioned_for_an_execution_of_the/), [/r/Coronavirus](http://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/faq6ba/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/) and [/r/Covid2019](http://np.reddit.com/r/Covid2019/comments/fajnkt/north_koreas_first_confirmed_covid_19_patient/).\n\n*NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.
