They are talking about long after the first infection. If that's not it then it is likely being confused with secondary infections and or false negatives. \n\nIf it did, after being completely beaten without outside help (anti-virals etc), it would only be some time well after recovery. (months at least) As T-Cells and their antibodies would still be flooding the body for some time. Any later re-infection from a non significantly mutated virus would likely end in a rout! Any secondary or reinfection would almost assuredly be shorter and likely less severe as well.
