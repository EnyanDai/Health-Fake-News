He's also saying China's only issue was waiting too long which is kinda 50/50 since you can't just shut down china because some people are sick.\n\nI don't trust china for basically everything but I don't think in terms of stopping the spread they're trash.\n\nA couple weeks ago everyone wouldn't believe shit unless WHO put it out and now everyone is turning back on that.
