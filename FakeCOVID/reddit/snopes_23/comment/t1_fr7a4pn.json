There have been many reports of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 after their initial infection. However, the main question was: \"Are these people infectious?\"\n\n>In the study, researchers tried to isolate infectious coronaviruses from samples taken from 108 people who retested positive. All of those samples tested negative. When the scientists examined 23 of those patients for antibodies against the coronavirus, almost all had [neutralizing antibodies](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us) that can stop the virus from getting into cells (*SN: 4/28/20*). That immune response may protect a person from getting reinfected, at least in the short term.  \n>  \n>Now, \u201cwe can largely stop worrying about reinfection and address the next big questions,\u201d Rasmussen says. \u201cHow protective are immune responses in recovered patients, and how long does immunity last?\u201d\n\nThis is ***great*** news! What this means is that people are getting the virus, but appear to be immune to it. Yes, they test positive, but they are not spreading the virus nor are they showing any symptoms. This means that a lot of people who have recovered and have antibodies are effectively immune from the diseases. Yes, they test positive for it, but the diseases is not infectious.\n\n**TR;DR** \\- People who retest positive for SARS-CoV-2 are effectively immune and not infectious. How long this effective immunity lasts is the next question.", "created_utc": 1589942744.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr7a4pn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gn0whq", "parent_id": "t1_fr762ni", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr7a4pn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gn0whq/new_data_suggest_people_arent_getting_reinfected/fr7a4pn/"}
