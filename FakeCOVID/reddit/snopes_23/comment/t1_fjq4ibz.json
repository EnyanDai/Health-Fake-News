The silenced doctor talked about SARS coming back and tell everyone be careful in a private Wechat group. I didn't know anyone said there should be a mass quarantine at the very start of the virus. \n\n> they waited too long and had to do a blanket quarantine over the whole city.\n\nI just think you are being ridiculous with your expectation of the Chinese government responses. Pandemic happens all the time (Ebola, SARS, MERS, H1N1, influenza). Even after the Wuhan lock down, most countries were not taking it seriously and letting it spread further. I don't think you are being objective when assessing the situation and China's response. You are looking for a perfect response but that have never happened in history of pandemics, at least i can't name one where a perfect government responses that stopped a pandemic.", "created_utc": 1583567272.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjq4ibz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_femvc3", "parent_id": "t1_fjq29pt", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjq4ibz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/femvc3/who_says_theres_no_evidence_of_reinfected/fjq4ibz/"}
