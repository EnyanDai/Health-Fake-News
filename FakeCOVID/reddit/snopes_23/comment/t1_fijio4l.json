Even when I was up to speed I wasn't 100% sure if the third infection is worse or the same as the second infection, sorry about that. But I've refreshed my memory a bit, so here goes.\n\nDengue infection has four main possibilities: no symptoms; mild dengue fever, with your standard viral symptoms (fever, headache, vomiting, etc); dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), with the previous symptoms plus severe abdominal pain and bleeding under the skin/from gums and blood in urine/vomit/stool; dengue shock syndrome (DSS), involves going into shock and multiple organs failing essentially due to internal bleeding.\n\nWith dengue, your first infection is more likely to be on the milder side, without symptoms or generic viral symptoms that clear up in about a week. If you're infected by a second strain you're much more likely to get DHF or DSS. And those are really bad. It's all probabilistic though, based on a bunch of different factors. You could get DHF from your first exposure (I think), and a secondary exposure can be mild. In terms of the way you phrase it, I suppose first exposure would probably be 1-5 and secondary exposure is more likely to be 4-9.\n\nSome strains are more aggressive than others, and so are more likely to cause worse symptoms initially. And your own immune state will determine your disease to some extent. Oh, and a fifth strain was identified in 2013, so there are five strains.\n\nSources:\n\nS Rajapakse (2011) dengue shock.
