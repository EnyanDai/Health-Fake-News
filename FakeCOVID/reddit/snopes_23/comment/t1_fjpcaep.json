Their reports on the cornavirus were not objective at all and they've frequently downplayed the threat.\n\nSo instead of believing anybody, it's best to look at various sources and think about what is most likely the truth or atleast closest to it.\n\nedit: I realized how terrible my wording was, so I'm gonna clarify it a bit. What I meant was doing your own research. Looking at what scientists/doctors say, etc. and not listening to  \"random clowns\". Determine yourself how trustworthy a Source is based on evidence and not your own bias.\n\nAs an example, while I do not trust WHO, I do not think that they're completely untrustworthy, I just think that they're biased in favour of China. They obviously have an agenda, but at most they'll make things look better for China. This means things like tips to reduce the spread, symptoms, vaccine information, tests, etc. are mostly trustworthy coming from WHO. However, they may choose not to mention some non-critical information in favour of China (like praising China, but not mentioning the huge coverup in the beginning), lie about how trustworthy China is (calling China transparent... Really?) or downplaying the threat.
