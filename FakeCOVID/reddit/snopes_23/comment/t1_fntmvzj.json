Are any of those consistent with the wild claim of \"denies existence of the virus\"? Or am I the only one who bothers to read the links while you can just say whatever?\n\n>isn't exactly wrong\n\nThat's not how right and wrong work. If A is true, and plausibly consistent with B, it doesn't prove the truth of B. You have to independently prove B if you're going to insist that B is a fact.\n\n>when the government is banning state media from saying it\n\nThe article you linked specifically states that \"as of March 25, state-controlled media were running stories mentioning coronavirus.\" So - no.\n\n>arresting anyone talking about it\n\nYou're also making that up. Your article cites [another article](https://www.azathabar.com/a/30510780.html) saying some people were arrested for discussing it in public, with no word on the scale or consequences of the arrests, - which is rather different. The same article also details several government response measures against COVID-19 as well as the fact that the state media is discussing it. (The source is \"Radio Liberty\", which is a Cold-War-era US state media program, so it's also to be taken with a grain of salt.)
