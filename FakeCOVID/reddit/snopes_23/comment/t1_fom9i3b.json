Can't  remember everything, however, so I'll keep it simple for my own sake. AFAIK, when you inject a vaccine, there are certain white blood cells which seek out the foreign bodies, learn about them and figure out to kill them. They then send it to the type of blood cells that fights them and kills them. Then certain white blood cells record the information of that virus, and remember how to kill it. Because the white blood cells are programed to believe that all foreign bodies = death, they keep this info on record, so that when it returns, they can kill it instantly without having to take time to figure it out. Hence why some people may carry the flu for a couple days, but exhibit no symptoms and are over it very quickly. Because vaccines are an unarmed piece of the virus, they are almost the same as the virus, DNA-wise. So when the white blood cells find the actual virus, they go, \"I don't know this thing, but I know about this other thing with is pretty similar.\"", "created_utc": 1587882358.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fom9i3b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g85zjc", "parent_id": "t1_fom7yuw", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2si6m", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fom9i3b", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/DeFranco/comments/g85zjc/who_warns_against_coronavirus_immunity_passports/fom9i3b/"}
