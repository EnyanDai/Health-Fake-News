Its conservative/authoritarian government has engaged in censorship (as it usually does), but it never denied the existence of the disease - so whoever told that to you is a liar.\n\nBoth Turkmenistan and Tajikistan report 0 cases. They're rather remote countries with low population density, low international trade volume, authoritarian governments willing to set quarantines, and socialized medicine. Is it so impossible that they really have 0 cases? It may also be possible that they haven't detected any, despite efforts to do so.
