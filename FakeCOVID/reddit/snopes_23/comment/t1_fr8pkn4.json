This is a really weird disease.  Something like 75% of patients who test positive have NO IDEA they are even exposed or infected; no symptoms, no nuthin'.\n\nI was DEATHLY ill for well over two weeks.  The chills and aches were off the charts, even compared to flu. Blinding headache, breathing was torture, coughing was worse.  In those, say 18 days, my fever was 99-101.2F, except for ONE day when it popped up to 102F for a couple of hours. .  \n\nEvery time I've had the flu, I got up to 103F, at least. \n\nI hope since we failed to contain it early, that until they get the vaccine on board, a lot more people are now immune than are documanted after having mild cases, thus approaching herd immunity levels faster than predicted.  \n\nCheers.", "created_utc": 1589983877.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr8pkn4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gn0whq", "parent_id": "t1_fr7lk72", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr8pkn4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gn0whq/new_data_suggest_people_arent_getting_reinfected/fr8pkn4/"}
