I did not have time to look into everything but some of your data seems inaccurate.\n\nWHO reports [59,000 rabies deaths annually](https://www.who.int/rabies/epidemiology/en/).\n\nSources vary but this site shows [over 195,000 deaths globally](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200405-sitrep-76-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=6ecf0977_4) from COVID-19 and that\u2019s just in 5ish months. \n\nEven if these numbers are slightly inflated (I\u2019ve seen and heard theories about global numbers being both inflated and deflated so it\u2019s hard to know exact numbers) it\u2019s safe to say it is killing more people than rabies, in a much shorter time, and with global shut downs and social distancing reducing the spread.\n\nI could try to find sources for your other claims, but am open to having my mind changed if you have data to support your statements. From experts and news I\u2019ve seen COVID-19 is more deadly and more contagious than the seasonal flu, hepatitis, Ebola, and HIV. One key difference is that it\u2019s airborne meaning you can get it without direct contact or explosive to bodily fluids.\n\nI think it\u2019s dangerous to say this is a scare tactic when so many (including some young healthy people) are getting sick and dying. It is scary and hard to see so many unemployed and facing financial hardship. There\u2019s no way around that. I think there are ways that we can and will learn to live with this virus and it doesn\u2019t have to be a binary open everything or close everything situation. I\u2019ve heard plans from some states in the US to open slowly in phases, monitor cases/deaths, and adjust accordingly. If it ends up being overblown and cases don\u2019t spike then we can all get back to \u201cnormal.\u201d But at least this gives us time to react and adjust in case it turns out to be the serious pandemic that many believe that it is.", "created_utc": 1587880136.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fom6zkl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g85zjc", "parent_id": "t1_fom4tja", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2si6m", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fom6zkl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/DeFranco/comments/g85zjc/who_warns_against_coronavirus_immunity_passports/fom6zkl/"}
