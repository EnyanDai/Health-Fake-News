I\u2019m italian, Italy was the first western country to ban flights from China yet look where we ended up. Third most infected country in the world.  \n  \nHow were they right? The virus has spread outside of China. This has obviously only been possible because countries didn't close borders and stopped Chinese from entering the country. Thanks to China and WHO, Italy is now a hotspot, and even now many countries continue to do zero screening for Italians entering the country.  \n  \n> I never ever received a package from China in less than 9 days, it would take even much longer now with the lockdowns so technically they are right.  \n  \nGood for you? Just because you buy cheap shit on aliexpress/wish that takes 1-2 months to arrive, then it doesn't mean the same is true for other people.", "created_utc": 1583579252.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjqy7oi", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_femvc3", "parent_id": "t1_fjqu6yj", "score": -2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjqy7oi", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/femvc3/who_says_theres_no_evidence_of_reinfected/fjqy7oi/"}
