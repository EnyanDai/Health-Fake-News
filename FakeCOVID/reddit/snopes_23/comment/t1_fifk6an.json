The report said he had previously been cleared of the virus by medical staff.\n\nThe Sichuan Health Commission confirmed the news on Friday (Feb. 21) and issued a community warning announcement in the patient's neighborhood. The announcement said that the man and his family had been transported to a nearby health facility on Thursday morning (Feb. 20) and that health officials had sanitized the entire community, reported\u00a0Liberty Times.\n\nAccording to\u00a0ETtoday, the patient and his family had been under home quarantine and had not left the house since Feb. 10. The authorities are still investigating the cause of the reinfection.\nThe news has stirred up heated reactions from Chinese netizens. Some suspect that the hospital discharged the man before he was fully recovered, and many have expressed concern about the worsening epidemic.\n\nSeveral\u00a0doctors\u00a0from Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, said last week that it is possible for recovered patients to contract the virus a second time. They warned that a recurring infection could be even more damaging to a patient's body and that the tests are susceptible to false negatives.", "created_utc": 1582390593.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fifk6an", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_f7v5xm", "parent_id": "t3_f7v5xm", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dqnia", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fifk6an", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/cvnews/comments/f7v5xm/chinese_coronavirus_patient_reinfected_10_days/fifk6an/"}
