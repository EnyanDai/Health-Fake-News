Influenza has the magical shape shifting ability to spawn any outer shape it can think of without a full mutation cycle. That isn't present in Covid-19. All fragments must be parts of the infected cell, not a novel indistinguishable seamingly random outermost layer, as found in influenza.\n\n\nThe virus remnants are directly related to the structure of the infected cell.\n\nSweep > qPCR base dataset > find common fragments/strands > compare strands/fragments to infected cell > determine through statistical analysis the fragments, of which if found by PCR, indicate the virus has been effectively destroyed by the immune system.\n\nTLDR: T-Cells and immune responses destroy cells and the building blocks of cells in predictable ways, the breaking points. The fragments are not novel, a test for the 25 most common fragments isn't more than 2 weeks to come up with for a small team, 60 technicians and a couple of university labs or ideally a military infectious disease pathogen investigation BSL4 lab.", "created_utc": 1588390046.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fp8e64h", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gbazii", "parent_id": "t1_fp5vd37", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fp8e64h", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gbazii/recovered_patients_who_tested_positive_for/fp8e64h/"}
