Using the blood groups as proxies, we estimate a 50 per cent higher protection for [blood type] O and a 50 per cent higher risk for A,&quot; said Prof Franke.\n\n> Separate studies from China and the United States have also shown that people with blood type A are more susceptible to the disease than those with type O, the more common blood type.\n\n> During the 2002 to 2003 epidemic of Sars - the coronavirus most closely linked to Covid-19 - researchers also found that those with type A blood were more likely to contract the disease.\n\n\n*****\n[**Summary Source**](https://smmry.com/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/people-blood-type-likely-suffer-severe-coronavirus-symptoms/) | [FAQ](http://autotldr.io/ \"456249 summaries so far.\") | [Feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **blood**^#1 **type**^#2 **more**^#3 **research**^#4 **Covid-19**^#5\n\nPost found in [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/gwnvw5/people_with_blood_type_a_more_likely_to_suffer/) and [/r/China_Flu](http://np.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/gwo4jz/people_with_blood_type_a_more_likely_to_suffer/).\n\n*NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.
