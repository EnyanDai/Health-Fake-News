I asked my fiancee who is working on a PhD in a neuro to help me to understand. She didnt think there was a difference. \n\nNow her speciality is not medicine and wikipedia is not the end-all for knowledge. But I cannot find anything that supports your argument. I also do not have the same resources as you.\n\nI am genuinely interested in learning. I'm not asking you to dumb it down for me, I can get someone to help me decipher the medical terms if I dont get them.\n\nMy fiancee and I were having a discussion before I commented about whether you could determine AO from AA based on like quantity of antigen. Like maybe because the gene is there twice you will end up with more? We couldnt find and answer. I'm sure an answer exists, but we do not have the resources to find it. I would really appreciate if you could help answer this too.\n\nI'm sorry if I seemed like I was coming from an place that was not genuine. I took issue with your tone, but that does not give me the right to insult you.", "created_utc": 1591365530.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fsz1i1f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gwqg4a", "parent_id": "t1_fsyhh2b", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fsz1i1f", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwqg4a/people_with_blood_type_a_more_likely_to_suffer/fsz1i1f/"}
