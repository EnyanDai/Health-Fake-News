So, if you have A blood type, you can get A blood. If you have B blood type, you can get B blood. And if you have AB blood type, your body is used to both (since you have both) so you can get either.\n\nIf you have O blood type, you don\u2019t have either A or B. You\u2019ve just got nothing. That means it doesn\u2019t matter who your blood goes into, they won\u2019t have an immune response to it because there\u2019s nothing to respond to! It also means that *everything* is foreign to you, so you can only get O blood.\n\nThe breakdown of who you can get blood from is like this:\n\nAB - A, B, or O\n\nA - A or O\n\nB - B or O\n\nO - only O\n\n\nThe + and - work kind of similarly. If you\u2019re +, then you have a specific protein in your blood. If you\u2019re -, you don\u2019t. So, + people can only give to + people, but - people can give to either.\n\nThere\u2019s >100 of these different proteins in your blood, but the quick blood typing they do only tells you whether your A/B/O and +/-. Only a few dozen people in the world are - for every single one of those blood proteins, and they have \u201cgolden blood\u201d that\u2019s super valuable.", "created_utc": 1584462793.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkr6hwh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fk25dk", "parent_id": "t1_fkqpi3f", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkr6hwh", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fk25dk/people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more_vulnerable/fkr6hwh/"}
