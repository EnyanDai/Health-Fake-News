The pattern existed across different age and gender groups.\\*\n\n\\*Blood types vary in a population. In the United States, about 44 per cent of the population is type O, while about 41 per cent is type A. In Wuhan, which has a population of about 11 million, type O is 32 per cent, while A is 34 per cent among healthy people. Among Covid-19 patients, it was about 38 (O) and 25 (A) per cent.\\*\n\nHere are the stats:\n\nP(type = A | COVID+ & died) = 85/206 = 0.41\n\nP(type = O | COVID+ & died) = 52/206 = 0.25\n\nP(type = A | COVID+) = 0.25\n\nP(type = O | COVID+) = 0.38\n\nP(type = A) = 0.34\n\nP(type = O) = 0.32\n\nNot really a strong study they need to provide a mechanism or hypothesis of mechanism.  Also they have to study whether other factors are correlated with the blood type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso entire families died -- could it be possible that people of similar blood types all just dies and that skewed the stats?", "created_utc": 1584464584.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkr9r3y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fk25dk", "parent_id": "t3_fk25dk", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkr9r3y", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fk25dk/people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more_vulnerable/fkr9r3y/"}
