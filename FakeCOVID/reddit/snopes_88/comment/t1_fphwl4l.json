And whatever services are needed to keep you healthy and safe are provided for by the government (seeing as it would probably cost them less than the billons they are spending to keep the economy afloat). I stand in the middle, I don\u2019t think people want you or others to die so they can get their nails done maybe some do and that\u2019s just fucked up... but the economic disaster from all this means many many families cannot afford to feed their children. Depression and suicide rates will climb as well as physical abuse... it\u2019s more complex than people selfishly wanting to get their nails done.
