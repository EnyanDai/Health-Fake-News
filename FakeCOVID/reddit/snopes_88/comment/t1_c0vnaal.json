{"author": {}, "body": "You know, on Reagan: I kinda went through a bell curve on my opinion of him.  As I was just leaving my youthful liberalism, I really liked him.  Then as I read more, I lost some of my love for him.  At one point I felt he was downright dangerous, like everyone else since FDR.  But now, as I'm reading *still more,* I find my opinion of him on the upswing again.\n\nI suspect libertarians demonize him for being imperfect... but when you read about the era just before him, the scale of government power was astonishing.  When I read about the 70's, I realize that I would have left the USA if I'd been an adult.  (Full disclosure: I am making some pretty solid leave-the-USA plans right now).", "created_utc": 1280575741.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "c0vnaal", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cviqz", "parent_id": "t1_c0vlddr", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c0vnaal", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/cviqz/just_as_physical_strength_does_not_justify_the/c0vnaal/"}
