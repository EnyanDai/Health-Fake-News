There is too much entitlement to those who want to have a steady moving country amidst a deadly virus. It is a tremendous waste of time trying to move forward allowing a big portion of the population to die off. It is three times more efficient to sustain whole human lives for the betterment of the entire human race, so realistically its survival of the fittest race.\n\nThe *human* race\n\nEspecially compared to some animals within the ecosystem, or those humans complaining about the economy plummeting for a little while. Is that going to let you feel like you are defeated in the race of survivability towards finding new suns and new planets to populate? Wouldn't some people find the logic in more humans can mean more probability of our survivability? Even some of the worst murderers and rapists have the BEST autoimmune system, but they contribute NOTHING to the human race. There are so many factors that deter anybody having validity in saying this coronavirus lockdown is causing us to lose touch with a stable economy. Too many others factors contribute, but saving human lives that have so much mental power behind their brain just seems like a *no-brainer*.", "created_utc": 1588622019.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fphishx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gdc61w", "parent_id": "t3_gdc61w", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh96", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fphishx", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/self/comments/gdc61w/nothing_pisses_me_off_like_the_protestor_with_the/fphishx/"}
