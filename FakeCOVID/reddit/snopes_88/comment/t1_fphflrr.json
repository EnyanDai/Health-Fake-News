The thing is, the \u201cweak\u201d aren\u2019t frail useless members of society, they are your neighbors, mother, brother, or grandmother Young people with autoimmune disorders.  Children with asthma.  Parents with cancer.  My little brother is 10.  He has asthma, and 10 out of the 12 months in a year he is coughing and it sounds like his lungs might just come up too.  Covid-19 would be detrimental if he got it.  There are many people like him with health issues that aren\u2019t their fault.  Saying incredibly offensive and disgusting things like \u201csacrifice the weak\u201d isn\u2019t getting your point across, it isn\u2019t helping you, and it makes you a complete asshole.  This selfish attitude helps no one and just shows how incredibly self-centered and vile you are.  I am a perfectly healthy young adult and even I don\u2019t want the risk of getting covid-19.  I may not be part of the so called \u201cweak\u201d but I sure as hell don\u2019t want assholes playing the natural selection game running around out here either.  Being sick is horrible.  I had the flu for two weeks and I wouldn\u2019t even wish that upon anyone.  I can\u2019t imagine thinking that killing someone with reckless behavior is excusable because that person is \u201cweak\u201d.", "created_utc": 1588620416.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fphflrr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gdc61w", "parent_id": "t3_gdc61w", "score": 35, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh96", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fphflrr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/self/comments/gdc61w/nothing_pisses_me_off_like_the_protestor_with_the/fphflrr/"}
