Being old and catching this virus is not a death sentence, most will be fine with treatment. If we don't slow the growth at the right time then we will have a lot of deaths, not necessarily old people or those with underlying health issues. If the hospitals are too busy we will have deaths that are unrelated to the virus rise too. If you have a stroke or a heart attack and the ambulances are busy dealing with a high influx of people, struggling because of the virus, who will come to save you? 81, fall and brake a hip, get to hospital, what happens then? We need to slow the rate at which this is spreading soon in my opinion, or what is happening in Italy will soon become a reality here.", "created_utc": 1584270307.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkk249f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fizhdx", "parent_id": "t3_fizhdx", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2f3oes", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkk249f", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fizhdx/is_this_the_next_step_after_the_over_70s_are/fkk249f/"}
