I ask that you do everything in your power to limit all unnecessary\u00a0movement and social contact in order to delay the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Failure to do so is guaranteed\u00a0to overwhelm our medical infrastructure. In addition, measures that bolster our capacity to treat serious and severe cases of COVID-19 must be undertaken immediately. The economic impact of these measures while significant are unimportant in the face of the potential loss of life and long term damage to Canada. The more aggressively we move at this pivotal time the more likely we are to minimise the losses both human and economic and the better positioned the nation will be once we emerge from this crisis. I implore you to not shy away from choices that may seem extreme. Those choices only appear so by the light of yesterday's world. Let us lead by example in the world of today. All of the world needs hope and the people of Canada need leaders of vision and strength.", "created_utc": 1584250677.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjmfod", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjl3qo", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjmfod", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjmfod/"}
