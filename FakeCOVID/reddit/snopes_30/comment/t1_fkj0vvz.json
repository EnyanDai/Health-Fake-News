It\u2019s being applied in perhaps a way we don\u2019t usually think of (pandemic vs mass casualty) but this is something we learn, teach and train nurses and doctors on. \n\nWe drill, we practice and now it\u2019s going to be put into play. Going forward and in the coming years, you\u2019re going to have an entire global healthcare workforce with the scars of this. We\u2019ll \u201clook\u201d ok but we won\u2019t be. We\u2019re gonna have to figure out how to heal, all of us as a people, but especially as doctors, nurses, techs, RTs etc, we\u2019re gonna have to find our way back.\n\n\nEdit-\n\nI\u2019ve seen some comments regarding \u201cthere should be an algorithm\u201d. Yeah we\u2019re in healthcare. There\u2019s systems and algorithms for everything. Like I said, we tend to train for this from a mass casualty (trauma) standpoint but I suspect it\u2019ll just be adapted for what we\u2019re now facing.
