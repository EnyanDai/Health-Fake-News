And I'm not trying to downplay the seriousness at all, but it is logically sound that our lower population density plus additional time to prepare and start taking behavioral adjustments will result in a much flatter infection curve than places like South Korea and Italy.  I know many are not as optimistic as me but I honestly doubt that our healthcare system will be greatly overrun.  There will be pressures certainly, but I think we are much better equipped to handle this than most people are giving credit for.  Look at the numbers right now, the death toll in the U.S. is still currently under 70, out of a country of 330 million.  That's nothing to baulk at but it is important to keep perspective.
