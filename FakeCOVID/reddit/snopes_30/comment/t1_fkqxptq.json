That\u2019s what premiums have skyrocketed 400%. Insurance for one person wasn\u2019t $350 when this all started. \n\nImagine if you told a car insurance company that they had to charge the same price for someone who\u2019s had 5 DUIs and 4 crashes as you would for someone with a clean record. They would have to then spread that cost to everyone. That\u2019s why the marketplace is fucked and everything\u2019s expensive. \n\nThe ACA fundamentally broke the insurance model and screwed over a huge amount of middle class people. Remember, the poor get free medical care in the US. The people who got screwed were the ones who made too much to qualify for Medicaid, yet couldn\u2019t afford the outrageous prices on the marketplace.", "created_utc": 1584457798.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkqxptq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fjtjuh", "parent_id": "t1_fkqurl9", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3fuwj", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkqxptq", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskThe_Donald/comments/fjtjuh/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkqxptq/"}
