I was asking a question to try to become educated on the situation. Assuming all of your sources are correct (can\u2019t confirm because they are in another language) then why are first hand accounts like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeB5S7lAdSo) easy to find? Is this fake news? Or a doctor sensationalizing the situation? Again these are genuine questions that I am not challenging you on just curious about. Hoping to get a little glimpse into what might be headed my way here in the US. \n\nThe primary thing from your post that I would like more clarification on is that it sounds like you are insinuating that there are/were 5200 ICU beds free to deal with corona patients. While in reality a lot of those beds probably already have people in them (have seen 75-80% capacity during winter months quoted, not sure what that translates to today). I would be curious how many of those 5200 are actually free for patients with corona.\n\nAdditionally, my statements in the comment you replied to were commenting on the fact that the article was discussing a protocol to handle a situation should they reach capacity. Does anything you said provide evidence contrary to that?", "created_utc": 1584289213.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkkpiq6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkkl0zo", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkkpiq6", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkkpiq6/"}
