I mean here... elsewhere. I'm not running from coronavirus. It's already spreading rapidly in my local community. Went from one to three to eight confirmed cases in three days and when county health updates on Monday twenty bucks says it jumps again. That's confirmed, too. More walking around. I get it or don't at this point. I won't die from it. My only preexisting condition is a missing appendix and some intermittent back pain from a car wreck. I can afford a month or six off work because I was saving for a house.\n\nI mean, all I can do is wash my hands, refuse to shake hands with customers and buy two boxes of cold medicine and a pack of throat lozenges before it's gone and leave most behind for people that will need it. Stocked up my pets for food and weather the storm.\n\nIf I do get sick I lock myself in my room, wash my sheets a lot, wear a mask to try and keep my family from getting sick and call out of work until I'm not a walking viral count. All I can do. I've reached a level of zen with COVID-19.\n\nI get sick or do not. I hide if I do get sick. I will be careful until that does or does not happen. Whatever happens, happens. My stock market account is down. I cannot change it. Not quitting my job and hiding. My 401k, IRA and brokerage accounts will recover. Grandpa's nursing home will get hit hard or it won't. He's got dementia and needs round the clock care so he has to stay somewhere. Life is what it is. Disaster comes or it does not.\n\nNothing I can do but do what is reasonable to protect myself and others.
