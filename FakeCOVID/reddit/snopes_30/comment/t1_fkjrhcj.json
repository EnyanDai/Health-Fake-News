But it just seems... we hear about 40 deaths here, or 100 deaths there, and we freak out... while many more have died from heart disease, cancer, stroke, car crashes, etc.... far far more. \n\nThe avg age of the dead is around 80, and they have comorbidities. So, if they die from corona then they will not have died from the comorbidity that they would have eventually died from. I guess my point is that it doesn't seem like the corona virus should be credited for 100% of the death when the person may have already been close to death from another disease. \n\nSo if 75 million die from corona, that will be many who have heart disease, cancer, diabetes... and that will reduce the number of people who die from those diseases. In other words, the total number of people who die in the world each will probably remain about the same, which is about 55-60 million.\n\nThe corona is here to stay, some will die, it is inevitable. The goal now is to mitigate so that it doesn't overtax the medical system. But it seems like many people are wanting to snuff out the virus so that we get to zero deaths.
