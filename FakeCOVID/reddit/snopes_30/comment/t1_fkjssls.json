They're just going to save you. They might flip through your wallet once you're stable for a name and/or contact information, but that's after they're certain you're going to survive. The doctors don't care about your insurance, or ability to pay. They're just trying to save a life. \n\nOnce you're conscious, they (the hospital, likely not your doctor) make inquiries to your name and insurance information. When you're healthy, they present you with a bill. You say \"I have no insurance, and cannot pay this.\" The hospital then either negotiates it down to something manageable (seriously, they'll take 10% over nothing), sends the bill to collections (at which point the hospital doesn't even \"own\" the debt anymore), or writes off the debt (essentially reducing their tax burden) and moves on. \n\nIt's impossible to know what WILL happen. I can only tell you what the possibilities are. I don't even know what affects the decision of the hospital's finance department. Sorry.\n\nHappy to answer any other questions I can, though. I know a relatively great deal about American health insurance, after years dealing with it and hearing about it from my family.
