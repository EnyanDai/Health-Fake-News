It seems crazy to me that there is no middle ground between \"you get the care we feel is safest and most effective\" and \"you get no care at all\".\n\nInformed consent should be the only requirement for applying experimental processes to the treatment of patients that would otherwise slip through the cracks. I think given the choice of \"no respirator\" and \"DIY respirator that was assembled by amateurs according to a standardized template and passed basic QC checks\", most people would generally choose the latter.\n\nAs far as automating out some of the human labor requirements, most of what goes on involves monitoring vitals, fetching/administering drugs, physically maneuvering the patient, and resuscitating. The most reliable way to cover these responsibilities is generally to have skilled people cover them, but again, desperate times should allow for automated alternatives, even if they come with more risk than a team of highly skilled people.", "created_utc": 1584264317.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjxk2r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t3_fisiy7", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjxk2r", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjxk2r/"}
