That's solid your boss is being as accomodating as possible. My company just started allowing half staff remote login. The plan was to test half staff home yesterday, then depending how the system handled the load, allow full staff Monday-on, but they changed it back to half again until further notice despite the system handling it well yesterday. It's ridiculous how they're handling it, I'm in IT and we absolutely can do our jobs remote full time. For sure there are others who have it worse, and I feel for them wholeheartedly, but in this case I think we get a pass to be a bit more selfish in our ways.  The end justifies the means, within reason of course, like not beating someone to a pulp for toilet paper lol.  Anyway, stay safe!\n\n\n\n\nAdd:  Whoops, got on a bit of a ramble there, sorry bout that.", "created_utc": 1584246534.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkji0te", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjgkg1", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkji0te", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkji0te/"}
