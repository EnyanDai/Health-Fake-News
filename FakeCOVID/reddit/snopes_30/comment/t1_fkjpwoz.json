We are doing that already with coronavirus testing kits. People showing mild symptoms are told to stay at home, drink plenty of fluids, and maybe take some otc drugs. Sometimes they will be wrong and a person who they thought would live without hospital admittance gets worse or even dies.\n\nAnd it can change on the other hand. Sometimes a patient miraculously shows signs of recovery and is retriaged. Or more resources become available.\n\nTriage is unavoidable in some ways such as when it comes to organs and blood transfusions, but had we better prepared and handled this we wouldn't have to triage coronavirus tests or medical care for those with the virus.", "created_utc": 1584254476.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjpwoz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkiz9wn", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjpwoz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjpwoz/"}
