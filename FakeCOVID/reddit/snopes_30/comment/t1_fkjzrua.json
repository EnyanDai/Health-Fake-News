Just whow.\n\nUsing *stoning* as an example?\n\nStoning is an awful thing, but you do realize stoning is actually used to keep societal cohesion right?  \nThe intension is making society better, though through brutal means.\n\nIt's not far off from the US's death penalty, and it serves the same function while being just as barbaric. Both means murdering someone.\n\nNow as for people not being decent.   \nYou know who I would consider the least decent people?   \nWestern far-right. People like you.   \nYou fucks are the worst, you grow up being taught empathy and sympathy is worthless, that people you don't know are less-than. The less similar you are, the less they're worth.   \nIt's not really your fault, you grew up that way, just like you grew up \"Christian\". You didn't choose it, if you had grown up somewhere else you would be something else and your would-be parents would wish hell upon you (like \"good Christians\") for being born there.\n\nGood day.
