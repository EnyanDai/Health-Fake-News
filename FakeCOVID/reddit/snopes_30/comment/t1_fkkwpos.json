I'm sorry if you're behind a paywall.\n\nA few people are posting second hand information from friends and Twitter accounts.\n\nThis is the exact type of information that has been misleading.\n\nThe most egregious example is the Italian regional official (Mayor, I think) who announced no one over 60 is getting treatment. Ironically, the people retweeting this were trying to be alarmist, but did not realize just how aggressive a practice this would be. As a medical professional, 60 is YOUNG! We would be seeing 1000s and 1000s of deaths daily, not the tragic 100s.\n\nIf this doesn't turn around we could still be overwhelmed, but I salute my Italian colleagues who have done so much under such terrible circumstances. And my heart goes out to the patient suffering from COVID, or those who have loved ones dying from the flu, or having needed treatments delayed in these trying times.", "created_utc": 1584293535.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkkwpos", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkj5zol", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584332841.0, "name": "t1_fkkwpos", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkkwpos/"}
