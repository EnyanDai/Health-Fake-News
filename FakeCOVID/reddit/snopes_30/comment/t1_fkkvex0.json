Plenty of military personnel are doing all kinds of jobs that cause horrific trauma in combat zones that don\u2019t involve \u201ckilling people\u201d. They don\u2019t get to choose where they go or the politics that sent them there. They don\u2019t choose the battles or the enemy. They sign up. Just like I signed up, and just like I signed up to be an ER nurse. I don\u2019t choose the traumas I\u2019m gonna be exposed to when I walk into work. I have no clue what will happen when I walk through those doors. It may be a good day, it may scar me for life. \n\nMany people think healthcare professionals \u201ckill people\u201d because we didn\u2019t save their family members or we didn\u2019t move quick enough. There\u2019s no one answer. But to assume military personnel\u2019s trauma is self inflicted because they\u2019re \u201ckilling people\u201d is short sided. You can disagree with the politics of a mission or war, I have. You can vehemently disagree with the people in charge who send our troops to places they probably don\u2019t belong but don\u2019t for a second think most are there enjoying it. War is not fun. \n\nWe have a generation of young veterans trying to find their way back. Some are going to succeed, but just as many aren\u2019t. We as a nation are failing them too.
