I don't want my government to protect me. I want it to protect and uphold my constitution and empower \"ME\" to protect \"ME\" IE we the people.\n\nThey have specific duties to perform and I want them to do those and nothing else.\n\nI want them to control the borders (not walls. thats just stupid in extreme) I want them to collect data form advice and distribute this advice to we the people.\n\nI want a government that is trustworthy enough that the people willingly accept and enact the advice we intelligently come up with because ITS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.\n\nthere is quite a bit more but that is a start. that is what we need.\n\nWe need nationalized health care. period. and no extra taxes for it. DEFUND military budgets to pay for it. it will hardly dent their budget at all.\n\nWe need to do what CHINA did but on a willing volunteer basis and have the social safety net to PROTECT PEOPLE from the financial hardships of such actions.\n\nPROVIDE food and care FREEZE their bills (actually freeze then NOT accruing a balance) FREEZE all mortgages and credit card bills. total freeze. no interest no payments. resume later as if no time passed.\n\nRENT is different. the people collecting the rent need it as well. first thing you can do is 100% forgive all fees attached to that rent for that time period and then provide them with the \"profit\" portion of the rent. (so no taxes etc.. for that unit for that period of time etc..)\n\nits not something we can do now. this is something we have to work on to prepare for the future. the next time and there will be a next time.\n\nfreeze all corporate debt and rent (except the profit portion) so small businesses don't FOLD under the conditions.\n\nTHIS is the kind of things we need to work on.", "created_utc": 1584246577.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkji2kw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkj9dt9", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkji2kw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkji2kw/"}
