The shelves were veritably bare... no meat, no frozen food (except desserts), and the only thing in the canned vegetable aisle was creamed corn, diced tomatoes and a smattering of \u201cethnic\u201d canned veggies.\n\nAfter bemusedly wandering around this nearly barren store for an hour, I finally had roped together a substitute for my family\u2019s  \u201ctraditional\u201d Sunday breakfast.\n\nGiven the selection, I had to go with frozen pancakes (they just had opened a case), frozen sliced strawberries, the pricey, cage-free organic eggs, and some lonely vegetarian sausage on a shelf... and then excitedly saw they were putting out two cases of Potatoes O\u2019brien. \n\nI walked over to get a bag, and this Karen of a lady with (literally) 8 gallons of milk, 5 dozen eggs and 6 cases of Mac and Cheese in her cart snagged *both* the cases in their entirety before I had made it down the aisle to get just one bag.\n\nI ended up behind her in line, and while we waited, seriously considered following her out to the parking lot, punching her in the back of the head and taking the damn potatoes anyway. \n\nLuckily, established society still exists, along with repercussions for that... but I was kinda surprised at my own reaction, and was thinking how fragile our collective cooperation really is.", "created_utc": 1584249522.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjla1u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkj77wa", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjla1u", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjla1u/"}
