Im going to go on a somewhat quick short rant cause this shit is driving me crazy.\n\nIve been with this girl for near 9 months. Shes 31, recently divorced, and has 4 kids. Her dumbass ex husband ( who she splits custody with) decided he just had to go to new york just to visit for over a week, and he just got back like 3 days ago.\n\nIt's like dude you are just fucking asking to get your goddamn kids sick. They are 2, 3,5, and 9. All of them have been sick off and on the past few months as it is.\n\nSince hes been back the 3 year old has gotten pretty sick and the 2 year old is well on his way.
