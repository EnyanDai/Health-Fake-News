The rest of the article is behind a paywall. So it looks like the article is contradicting itself then, to people who can only see the top part. I can't see what you've quoted in the source, but surely you can see what I've quoted, which was a direct quote and seemed to have a straightforward meaning. Both of our quotes are directly from the article. Perhaps there is a different definition of intensive care in place, such as beds in that location vs intubation. Maybe they aren't calling intubation intensive care, I don't know. But anyway, I'm really not trying to argue about it.\n\nThe comment I responded to asked for the source from the original article. That was the source for their words. I provided the source for their words. It was not a report on what is and isn't happening. This is nothing more than that.\n\nTruly, I'm not naysaying that shit has officially hit the fan in Italy. I did recently read the personal account of Cristina Higgins from Bergamo whose statement was verified, if you know what I'm talking about. I'm with you on that. Just responded to a specific question to a specific statement, that's all.\n\nBut, if you would like to report to people that yes, it is happening.. this is a good source for that. Because most people, like me, won't be able to see the part you quoted in the article linked. https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cristina-higgins-coronavirus-post/\n\nSo, yes, I have seen some account of it happening. I wasn't saying it isn't happening.", "created_utc": 1584247899.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjjjvb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjjc7v", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjjjvb", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjjjvb/"}
