Mostly because, as you mentioned,  it decreased their profits(*).\n\nThey also lobbied against the Marketplace very aggressively and very specifically. A naive observer who believes free-market capitalism is perfect would expect them to LOVE the Marketplace, because it allowed them to compete solely on price/(perceived) value. But they didn't. So why not?\n\n(*: It actually didn't \"decrease\" their profits. Just to pick one company as an example, United Healthcare's profits have increased by around $2-4 billion every year since 2009. This makes sense, because the ACA also included subsidies designed to offset the rate levelling. However, it is likely that their profits did not increase as much as they would have otherwise.)", "created_utc": 1584466114.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkrch13", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fjtjuh", "parent_id": "t1_fkrazna", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3fuwj", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkrch13", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskThe_Donald/comments/fjtjuh/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkrch13/"}
