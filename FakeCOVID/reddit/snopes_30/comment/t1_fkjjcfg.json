So it looks like the article is contradicting itself then. I can't see what you've quoted in the source, but surely you can see what I've quoted, which was a direct quote and seemed to have a straightforward meaning. Both of our quotes are directly from the article. Perhaps there is a different definition of intensive care in place, such as beds in that location vs intubation. Maybe they aren't calling intubation intensive care, I don't know. But anyway, I'm really not trying to argue about it.\n\nThe comment I responded to asked for the source from the original article. That was the source for their words. I provided the source for their words. It was not a report on what is and isn't happening. This is nothing more than that.\n\nTruly, I'm not naysaying that shit has officially hit the fan in Italy. I did recently read the personal account of Cristina Higgins from Bergamo whose statement was verified, if you know what I'm talking about. I'm with you on that. Just responded to a specific question to a specific statement, that's all.\n\nBut, if you would like to report to people that yes, it is happening.. this is a good source for that. Because most people, like me, won't be able to see the part you quoted in the article linked.
