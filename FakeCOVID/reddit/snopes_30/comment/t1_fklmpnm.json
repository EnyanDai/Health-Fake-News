Even if you logically know that person had no chance, the thought that it could have gone a different way can still stay with you. \n\nYou're coming at this from the perspective of the patient or a bystander, but you have to also consider the perspective of the person who is enabling that death directly and what it could do to them. I don't think it should *illegal* because if the doctor is okay with taking on that burden, they should be free to do so--but you said it was a \"barbaric practice\" in response to having to resort to double effect as if every doctor should be okay with partaking in assisted suicide.\n\nEdit: It also stands in contrast to the fundamental principles of the [Hippocratic oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath):\n\n>I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrong-doing. **Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course.**\n\nFinally, one of the things that I think most redditors would agree with is that capital punishment should be outlawed because **you might kill an innocent man**. We don't qualify that with \"capital punishment should be outlawed, unless you know for sure that he did it\". In the same way, all the evidence in the world might point to someone not having a better outcome, but when you help them die, you take away *any* chance of that.\n\nAll I'm saying is that you guys can feel righteous behind your computer screens but I've seen this both as the family member of a patient that begged for it, and as a medical student rotating with physicians who treated such patients. Regardless of how sure you are of the eventual outcome, it's not an easy thing to write someone's death warrant with your own hands.", "created_utc": 1584310011.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fklmpnm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkl7r51", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584310980.0, "name": "t1_fklmpnm", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fklmpnm/"}
