Things are out of stock because we're still looking to buy them, and while money/our trade system is still in power, you're right. We're selfish and scared. \n\nBut as soon as the bubble of capitalism pops, it's a whole different story. Now we're *actually* out here to survive. Now, government doesn't matter. And in this total collapse, is where we'll find the best and the worst that humanity has to offer, as the other poster may be implying.\n\nAs I said before, capitalism is the problem. It's that thin veneer that you're talking about. Because we're only as civilized as the stock on our shelves. If capitalism was smart, and wanted to support itself, it'd create a safety net that bails society out in emergencies where we have to shut down our schools and not go to work. Something like where medical care and food is provided for all while the threat blows over.\n\nBut... That's not where we're at. And maybe, that's not where this country, as it currently exists, is built to be. After all, we're all just part of a rat race to the top, and screw everyone below us. We love this race because of the promise of wealth and grandeur that's theoretically possible for anyone to achieve. That's what makes America so \"great.\" \n\nI ~~think~~ *hope* that this was enough of a wake up call for our leaders to reassess the situation of wealth and goods distribution, and certainly, some things are bound to change. We'll see if it's enough though.", "created_utc": 1584245023.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjg9sz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjakg2", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjg9sz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjg9sz/"}
