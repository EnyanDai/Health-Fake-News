The document, produced by the civil protection deparment of the Piedmont region, one of those hardest hit, says: &quot;The criteria for access to intensive therapy in cases of emergency must include age of less than 80 or a score on the Charlson comorbidity Index of less than 5.&quot;.\n\n> &quot;Should it become impossible to provide all patients with intensive care services, it will be necessary to apply criteria for access to intensive treatment, which depends on the limited resources available.\"\n\n> Italy has 5,090 intensive care beds, which for the moment exceeds the number of patients who need them.\n\n> &quot;We want to arrive as late as possible at the point where we have to decide who lives and who dies. The criteria relate only to access to intensive care - those who do not get access to intensive care will still receive all the treatment possible. In medicine we sometimes have to make difficult choices but it&#039;s important to have a system about how to make them.\"\n\n\n*****\n[**Summary Source**](https://smmry.com/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/14/italians-80-will-left-die-country-overwhelmed-coronavirus/) | [FAQ](http://autotldr.io/ \"442171 summaries so far.\") | [Feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **intensive**^#1 **care**^#2 **criteria**^#3 **patient**^#4 **access**^#5\n\nPost found in [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/), [/r/Coronavirus](http://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fisj9n/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/) and [/r/socialism](http://np.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/firykc/save_those_that_still_can_have_their_valorization/).\n\n*NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.
