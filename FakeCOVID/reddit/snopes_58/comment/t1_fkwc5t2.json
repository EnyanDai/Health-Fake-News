They're not all arabs, they're all french.\n2. Your comment is racist (come on, are you denying that ?).\n3. You sound like an old man who has been watching too much TV.

Your french is understandable at best, but I'm not mocking it (my english isn't great either). It's just that I read your comment before and thought you were french.
