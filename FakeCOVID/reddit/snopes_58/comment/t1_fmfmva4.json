Keep mug pressed near lips or cheek in between sips. The heat helps me find a comfort in my face/head area. Helps me take my mind off head pain.\n-bag of ice and a sock filled halfway with rice. Warm the rice sock in the microwave. Alternate the ice bag and the warm rice sock at the base of the skull. 1-2 minutes for each. \n-I\u2019ll put an audio book on (or radio) and have the volume turned to where I can hardly hear it. I then lay down however comfortable in the dark ( usually engulfed in pillows), and try to focus on listening and paying attention to the audio book. 9 times out of 10 I nod off and when I wake up my migraine isn\u2019t as bad.\n-rub icy hot on temples and neck (kinda strange but the tingling of the cream kinda short circuits the pain a bit) careful not to get it in your eyes or mouth.\n\nThings that other people SAY helps them but does not help me but you might as well try anyway:\n\n-rubbing your temples or wherever the agony is greatest.\n-Stretching your neck\n-drinking ice water\n-do yoga\n-rub peppermint under your nose\n-take a multivitamin and over hydrate.\n\nI hope at least one of these may help you.
