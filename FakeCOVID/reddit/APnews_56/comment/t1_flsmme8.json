I didn't read your whole diatribe because it's obvious you didn't read mine and you don't know history.\n\nThe two things that popped immediately were:\n\n1. There were 10 million people killed by the Nazis of various religions and ethnic origins.  I have no idea why you kept saying 6 million.  I never did.\n2. You seem to take issue with my \"more than a decade\" statement.   Yes Auschwitz was opened in 1941 BUT it wasn't the only death camp.  Dachau was opened in 1933.  That's over a decade. Wow, just wow that you didn't know that.\n\nI'm assuming you go on to peddle some revisionist holocaust denier bullshit\n\nYour inability read and retain the info from the simple paragraph I wrote demonstrates your lack of attention to detail and your tenuous grasp on reality.\n\nGood day", "created_utc": 1585445625.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flsmme8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fpwlqp", "parent_id": "t1_flsig9u", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585448284.0, "name": "t1_flsmme8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fpwlqp/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/flsmme8/"}
