You also sound like an excellent candidate for news anchor at CNN or MSNBC.\n\nThere's a small difference between 4,000 and 21 million. Something like, I dunno 20,999,600\u202c million, I think.\n\nHe's not saying there aren't many more dead than they are reporting, but tens of millions of dead bodies?\n\n**You are talking about 3 billion pounds of rotting corpses** in the middle of cities.\n\nYou can't bury or burn them there, and the stacks of bodies would be  hundreds of feet high. You would need **75,000 full sized semi cargo trucks** packed to their maximum 44,000 pound loads to move them.\n\nThey simply wouldn't be able to hide something of that scale from people on the ground or even satellites. It makes no sense; it's just numbers and common sense.\n\n>You also sound like an excellent candidate for news anchor at CNN or MSNBC\n\nAnd you my fine nut job, sound like you would be either an excellent commentator on Fox news or a homeless guy who screams at fire hydrants about Jesus.\n\nEdit: someformattingandwords\n\nEdit2: Needed the quote for posterity and some more words.", "created_utc": 1585343073.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flopvrf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fpwlqp", "parent_id": "t1_flomben", "score": 53, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585347196.0, "name": "t1_flopvrf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fpwlqp/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/flopvrf/"}
