Glad you brought it up. \n\nThe event that is colloquially called \"the holocaust\" involved killing \\~10 million people over more than a decade and across multiple countries. It was part of a planned initiative called \"the final solution\" that had been laid out and planned before it was even started.  Even will all that one of the biggest problems the death camps had was how to dispose of all the bodies. This is pretty well documented for [Auschwitz](https://www.pbs.org/auschwitz/40-45/factories/1942b.html)\n\nThe event in China didn't happen over a decade and across several countries.\n\nIt happened in a few months, mostly in one city.  Also 10 million for the Nazis.
