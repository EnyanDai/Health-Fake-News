But this statement seems to eliminate this as a possibility\n\n>The Chinese government has shut down many major factories, coal-fuelled power plants, and manufacturing to curb the coronavirus outbreak. So there is little chance that they could be responsible for the rising levels.\n\n>After finding out about the rising sulfur levels, users of the controversial website 4chan did some digging. They pointed out that a single human corpse, when set alight, releases 113 g of sulfur dioxide.\n\n>So to account for the rise in sulfur dioxide levels around Wuhan, one would have to burn 13,968 bodies.\n\nIf you multiplied this last figure by 100 cities, you get about 1.4 million bodies. Interestingly enough, that's about one half of the 2.8 million casualty figure I mentioned earlier.\n\nSo it's looking increasingly likely that China is lying about their situation. Actual number of cases and deaths is probably far higher than they've been willing to admit.\n\nSame thing happened 100 years ago during the Spanish Flu. Allies and Central Powers censored news and information about the flu because they didn't want to let the enemy know how bad they were getting hit.", "created_utc": 1584964639.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl9os43", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fni4z1", "parent_id": "t1_fl9nu37", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fl9os43", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fni4z1/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/fl9os43/"}
