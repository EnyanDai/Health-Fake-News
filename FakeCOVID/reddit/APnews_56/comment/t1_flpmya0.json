If I tell you I'm carrying 2500 pennies in my pocket but you can't even see a bulge in my pockets or hear jingling from that many coins...would you believe it?\n\nSmall lies do not stretch credulity. Big lies usually do. If China actually has 10,000 people dead from COVID-19, and they're telling us that 3,200 have died, that's pretty hard to fact-check if we don't have reporters in China. But if China is telling us that 3,200 people are dead when they've actually lost more than 1,000,000.....there would be readily observable evidence of many kinds to contradict their claim. Satellites would probably see it, domestic social media would spread it, evidence of new construction to hide the bodies would out the lie. It isn't easy to hide or dispose of that many corpses.", "created_utc": 1585363415.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flpmya0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fpwlqp", "parent_id": "t1_flplqrt", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flpmya0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fpwlqp/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/flpmya0/"}
