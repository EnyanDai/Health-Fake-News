We'll say an hour.\n\nGenerally you do it one body at at time. But we've got to be quick about things. Most cremation ovens you aren't fitting more than 3 people in at the same time. But hell, let's say 4 people. \n\nSo each oven is cremating 4 people an hour, or 96 bodies a day if they're running for 24 hours each with no time to change people or scoop out ashes. Let's say they have some absurd number of cremators going. Say 500. Please note that New York City has less than 10. But China is gonna China, so they have 500. 500 x96 means they are cremating a staggering 48,000 bodies a day.\n\n\nIt would still take them 437 days to cremate those many bodies.\n\n\n\nI have no issue believing the death toll in China is way higher than 4,000. If you told it was actual 40,000 or 120,000 I would find it believable. But it sure the fuck isn't going into to be in the millions and still be hidden from the world.", "created_utc": 1585346144.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flov6m7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fpwlqp", "parent_id": "t1_floi5z8", "score": 41, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flov6m7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fpwlqp/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/flov6m7/"}
