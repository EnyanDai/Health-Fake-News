But the problem with so much information is that it has ways of leaking out.\n\nYou cover up the primary data. But it's a lot harder to cover up all the secondary information that can be used to make inferences and deductions.\n\nIf China is lying about actual number of cases and actual number of deaths, the data about CV19 itself will be skewed. The mortality might be higher than reports suggest.\n\nOn the other hand, there is data from other nations that seems to support CV19 as being highly contagious and relatively low mortality. \n\nSo I'm willing to believe China has engaged in a coverup, believing that doing so was in their own security interests. I also believe that 21 Million deaths will prove impossible to keep secret over the long term. Sooner or later, someone will blab.\n\nLet's stick around and see what comes out.", "created_utc": 1584965268.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl9pemu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fni4z1", "parent_id": "t1_fl9o0j8", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fl9pemu", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fni4z1/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/fl9pemu/"}
