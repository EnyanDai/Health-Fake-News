Wuhan Virus.  Wu Flu.   Maybe millions of dead.  It's all China's fault.  Blah blah blah blah.  Okay, we get it, Breitbart and Epoch times want us to shut down trade with China, allow zero immigrants into the United States, do protectionist trade policies, and get rid of all taxes on the Mercers.  \n\nI think China is lying.  I think they have community transmission continuing right now.  I think they have it reasonably under control but don't want to alarm the public, just like Trump, about how long this is going to last and how economically damaging it's going to be. Japan lied to keep the Olympics. Span and Italy aren't lying.  Iran is lying. Netherlands and the UK has their heads up their ass.  I think Trump is an idiot to say we can open up in Easter.  I am uninterested in figuring out where the blame lies while people are looking for a scapegoat when what they should be looking at is how to help us get these masks, ventilators, tests, vaccines made and hiring people who might actually be able to come up with a plan to hit the economy less hard with a viable solution.   \n\nSo far, the only person I can tell that doesn't have their head up their ass is Bill Gates, probably because he's been working on eradicating polio for so long.  And Taiwan, because they've been planning for a pandemic and got it right.\n\nBreitbart and Epoch Times are once again taking a crisis and pushing a blatantly patent agenda.  And while I am interested in figuring out to what extent China is lying, and what the real numbers are, it is clear that these race-baiting, hate-baiting, hysteria and fury driven journalists are not going to help me get to legitimate answers.", "created_utc": 1585421229.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flrj25j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fpwlqp", "parent_id": "t1_flr8ro3", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flrj25j", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fpwlqp/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/flrj25j/"}
