The Holocaust did not last a decade.  There is no plausible evidence that any significant amount of the 6-11 million that were stated to have died did so before 1941.  The Jews were shamed and beaten prior to that but any attempted \"genocide\" is claimed to have occurred later.\n2. \"Most Holocaust historians define the Holocaust as the genocide of the European Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1941 and 1945.\"   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust)\n3. \"Historians agree that there was a \"gradual radicalization\" between the spring and autumn of 1941 of what Longerich calls Germany's *Judenpolitik*, but they disagree about whether a decision\u2014*F\u00fchrerentscheidung* (F\u00fchrer's decision)\u2014to murder the European Jews was made at this point.\"  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust)\n4. You said 10 million over 10 plus years.  I'm not sure where you're getting this because the well-cited Wikipedia article states that 11 million died in the \"Holocaust period\" we'll call it.

The 6 million number is everywhere.  It's the accepted number.  Wow, you didn't know that?
