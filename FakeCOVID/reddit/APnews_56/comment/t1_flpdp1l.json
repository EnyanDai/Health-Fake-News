For a couple of reasons. \n\n1. Most other viruses are named after where they were found. Ebola is a river, MERS is Middle Eastern, SARS is South Asia, Lyme Disease, Valley Fever, Zika. You get the point, this is how they are usually named.\n\n2. This is the name the CCP gave it themselves. Lijian Zhao called it the Wuhan Coronavirus in an official state sponsored message at first.\n\n3. China is now trying to push the conspiracy that this was created in America and brought to China.\n\n4. I am sick of the tired racist mantra they use to attempt to disarm any criticism against them. Mainland China is one of the most racist countries hands down without question. They just banned all foreigners, if you know anything about China and the Boxer Rebellion you know what is about to happen. There have been multiple viral outbreaks from the same breeding grounds. In fact, they even know where this basically comes from, they have a hidden cave with a reservoir of bats that carry these viruses. They know where it is, but won't tell anyone.\n\nThey knew it was coming, it happened before. They banned wet markets, then wet markets came back. They are culpable and we need to hold them accountable for their bullshit.", "created_utc": 1585357072.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flpdp1l", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fpwlqp", "parent_id": "t1_flo90u5", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flpdp1l", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fpwlqp/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/flpdp1l/"}
