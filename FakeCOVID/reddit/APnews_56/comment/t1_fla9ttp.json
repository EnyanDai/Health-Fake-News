The facts of the matter are China tried to bury this virus and seriously harmed the entire world AND simply must be under-reporting deaths due to their healthcare infrastructure severely lacking for this type of issue. \n\nThe real proof will be in 6-8 months when the supply chain I.e imported stuff from China stops coming. It will take a while to notice because China has been on lockdown for 8 weeks, now the US is getting hit and demands for lots of non-essential/luxury items like furniture, cook wear, and clothing is dropping due to loss of work, economic fears, money being used to stock food and so on. This leaves a plausible narrative that China didn\u2019t have that many deaths because supply and demand dropped back to back, when US demand for Chinese goods increases in 6-8 months when people are back to work, back on their feet financially, and willing to indulge in non-essential spending we will see how many containers are really coming from China and be able to gauge what the actual death toll is based solely on the fact we can\u2019t get the stuff we are used to because they can\u2019t keep up with demand. \n\nThis could lead to a price hike and move back to US manufacturing, which is what the $500B in the stimulus package was for I would speculate.", "created_utc": 1584979629.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fla9ttp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fnk19p", "parent_id": "t3_fnk19p", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fla9ttp", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fnk19p/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/fla9ttp/"}
