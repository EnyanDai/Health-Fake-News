I am sorry that the messages being put out by those setting policy led him to think that those who were \"paranoid\" or who knew they were sick could just stay home, and it would be okay for him and others to \"live their lives\". I am sorry for his family who lost someone. I am sorry that his wife is now also infected and who had to be at home while her husband was in the hospital.\n\nAt least according to the article it seems his family is encouraging people to maintain distance  and \"adhere to the lockdown\".", "created_utc": 1587593436.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo8bk26", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g69y1g", "parent_id": "t3_g69y1g", "score": 2610, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587593722.0, "name": "t1_fo8bk26", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/g69y1g/ohio_man_dies_from_covid19_after_criticizing/fo8bk26/"}
