I just said do not care if I get it\n\nDude, just stop arguing. It's like beating a dead horse wasn't enough and now you're abusing the soil beneath its corpse. You're contradicting yourself and strawmanning -- none of which are will ensure that you're *100% correct*. You cannot say you don't care if you contract the virus and then spew out the side of your mouth that you would quarantine to avoid  infecting your family.   \n\n\nThese two points do not align and indicate either A) you don't give enough of a shit about your family and you're willing to endanger your loved one's to prove a point; or B) you actually do care about your family and are willing to enact all necessary measures to save your life and that means foregoing your *rights* to ensure the safety of your loved ones.   \n\n\nYou continually postulate you're deprived of your *rights*; however, you're confusing that with *privilege.* Your complaints are *privileges* (i.e dining at a restaurant, drinking at a bar, going to a movie theater, etc.) but your *rights* (the right to medical service like TESTING FOR COVID-19, to vote, to drive, etc.) are not being infringed upon. Your *rights* are not being assailed, but your *privileges* are revoked to ensure that public health is not compromised. I'm sorry you can't go to Fuddruckers, but that's no one's problem but your own if you can't accept that fact.   \n\n\nNo one should pay for your stupidity, so enough with your selfishness and consider other people outside of your existence for once; you'll live a much more fulfilling life.", "created_utc": 1587673750.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "focobcl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g6fhsg", "parent_id": "t1_fobwmqu", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvz", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_focobcl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Washington/comments/g6fhsg/ohio_man_dies_from_covid19_after_criticizing/focobcl/"}
