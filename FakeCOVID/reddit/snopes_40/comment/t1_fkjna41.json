It does effect the respiratory system, which is why it's so bad on people with other respiratory conditions.   \n\\- It's not resisting treatments anymore than any other virus, health care workers have been fast at work figuring out the best treatments like they would for any other illness, and a vaccine is already in the works.   \n\\- If it suddenly disappears, it won't be a surprise or mystery, most countries have been taking measures to prevent it's spread. If it re-emerges, that's not too surprising either, as illness circle back around when new people not immune to them are exposed, or they mutate enough to re-infect people.   \n\\- Kim is basically famous for being famous, this is hardly a qualification of anything. And Browne basically has no qualifications, with a pretty bad 'psychic' track record. \n\nNot saying psychics prophecies are impossible, just that this one doesn't seem very accurate.", "created_utc": 1584251556.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjna41", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fiiobf", "parent_id": "t3_fiiobf", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjxn", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjna41", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Paranormal/comments/fiiobf/sylvia_browne_predicted_the_coronavirus/fkjna41/"}
