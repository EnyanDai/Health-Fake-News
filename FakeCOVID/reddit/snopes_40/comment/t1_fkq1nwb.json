The number of potential deaths from the virus, mostly affecting the elderly and those with preexisting respiratory or heart conditions, when compared to the total global population, isn't a very large number.\n\nTyphus, Scarlet Fever, Smallpox, Polio, Malaria: all of them were eventually put under control thanks to vaccines. Spanish Flu, the Asian Flu. And COVID-19 will be no different. This is not going to be a situation like the Black Plague. Technically HIV and AIDS still kills more people every year than COVID-19 probably ever will.\n\nThe quarantine efforts should be mandatory. A pandemic is a big deal. If COVID-19 becomes a seasonal virus like the run of the mill flu bug already is, it will be more deadly, and it will kill more people, and continue to every year just like the flu already does. However, the numbers are skewed, and the media is relentless in their fear mongering.\n\n>\"It will suddenly vanish.\" \n\nThat's typically what happens to viruses when proper quarantine procedures actually do their job. If everyone is lucky, COVID will vanish like a fart in the wind, much like SARS has because humanity did everything it could do to keep from giving the virus new hosts and a warm, cozy place to breed. In another ten or twenty years, another mutation will arise, this will happen again, wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nHopefully the \"Big One\" eventually comes along and wipes everyone out. It might help with the overpopulation problem we have these days. Every video and photo I see of people fighting over toilet paper makes me cringe. --- I have very little faith left in the majority of people.\n\nThank technology and transportation. One day our travel habits and population density will be the end of us.
