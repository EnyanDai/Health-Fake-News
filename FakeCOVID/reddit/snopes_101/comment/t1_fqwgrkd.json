Up until 2 weeks ago, I thought it was B.S. too.\n\n# 1 The only official investigation:\n\nFirst of all, the ONLY forensics investigation that happened into the authenticity of his birth certificate found 9 counts of forgery.[Here they are on CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO0Ogdod5ZI) saying there is no doubt the document is **fraudulent.** More detailed report [**here as well on ABC15**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BMOw8tqooc&t=182s)**.**\n\n# 2 Archive from whitehouse.gov\n\n[Here is an archive of Obama's birth certificate that was uploaded on the white house's website in 2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20110427171111/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-long-form.pdf), a PDF file that has LAYERS in it, separation of the background and the text. [(Video demonstrating that if you don't want to download the file yourself.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVIei87oFo&feature=emb_title)\n\n# 3 Comparison with other 1961 hawaii state birth cert.\n\n[Obama's](https://www.obamasrealfather.com/i/inside/documents/12-7-16-obama-birth.jpg) [Other Cert #1](https://www.obamasrealfather.com/i/inside/documents/BC-Bruce-Henderson.jpg) [Other Cert #2](https://www.obamasrealfather.com/i/inside/documents/BC-James-Gravely.jpg)\n\n\\- The most obvious weird thing is that the certificate is obviously a *scanned* document that cuts on the left, but somehow the background repeats?If they cut it like that, why is the signature and date stamp at the bottom outside of certificate?  \n\\- Zoom in: The font is inconsistent, different quality throughout the document (top-right number 1, question 7e's checkbox is diff qual, etc)  \n\\- They didn't use the word \"African\", they used words like \"Colored/Negro\".\n\n# 4 Obama's autobiography \"Dreams from my father\"\n\nHe talks about growing up with his grand parents in Hawaii. He was raised around his grandpa's friends such as  [Frank\\_Marshall\\_Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Marshall_Davis)\n\n>In Barack Obama's memoir Dreams from My Father (1995), Davis is referred to as a friend in Hawaii of Obama's maternal grandfather Stanley Dunham; Obama later identified the man as Davis.\\[37\\]\n\nFrank Marshall Davis was a member of the Communist Party of the USA who had been under surveillance of the FBI for years. He escaped them by moving to Hawaii. He wrote texts such as \"How to become a Communist\"\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jrrnkKmUzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jrrnkKmUzo)Here are his FBI files [http://omeka.wustl.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/fbeyes/davis](http://omeka.wustl.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/fbeyes/davis)\n\nAll he's ever done his whole career was create communist propaganda, infiltrate schools and intellectuals and brainwash college students.\n\n\\---\n\nI tried to keep it as short as possible not to flood with too much text, let me know if you want more info. Took me a while to type that.\n\nIt's not surprise ever since Obama was/left office, universities started pumping out little communist activists in full force.", "created_utc": 1589703847.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fqwgrkd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gl0qnx", "parent_id": "t1_fqwarad", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sh5g", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1589731889.0, "name": "t1_fqwgrkd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/metacanada/comments/gl0qnx/italian_government_call_for_arrest_of_bill_gates/fqwgrkd/"}
