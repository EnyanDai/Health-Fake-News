It's not like bacteria where they can gene swap on their own (plasmids, for example). For what you are talking about, both viruses need to be in the same cells where their replication can get mixed up. Usually this would just tank both viruses but it's possible one could be dominant and snag sequences during replication from the other. Even then it would be somewhat random what would result. \n\nWhich brings up the more interesting question of where these inserts came from. It's possible it evolved naturally. However HIV sequences are also used in a lot of virus research since there has been so much research done on it. I'm anxious to see the paper confirmed by another lab.", "created_utc": 1580502863.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fg4gdqa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ewsq59", "parent_id": "t1_fg4du3v", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dqnia", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fg4gdqa", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/cvnews/comments/ewsq59/hivs_genes_with_high_simiarity_are_found_in_the/fg4gdqa/"}
