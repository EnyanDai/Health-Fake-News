Even in older patients we are seeing a pretty low death rate if that is the goal. Plus each release means the public is more educated a out it. You already had asians, before this virus, wearing masks in public thanks to SARS and that vanished over a decade ago. It will increase dramatically now and sustain for years to come. Then those who survive are immune and you need to re-engineer for the next round which can take years because now you need a virus with different surface proteins while maintaining potency. There is a reason most bio-warfare research goes into bacterial agents vs viruses. And the tier 2 threats (microbes considered to be good starting points) that are viruses are not coronaviruses. Because on top of everything else they have a higher than average mutation rate and can mutate themselves into less dangerous variants. It is the same property that makes them so good at species hopping in the first place. \n\nThe flu will kill more, naturally, over a decade with no intervention, and is better than these virulent coronaviruses at spreading because it doesn\u2019t cause any alarm. Want more, carefully throttle back senior healthcare. Fake flu shots for a percentage of the elderly. Shit start anti-vax conspiracies about it. Those are way more contagious than this coronavirus. Cheap (actually saves money) and easy. Want even more?
