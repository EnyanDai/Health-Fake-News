An [image search](https://tineye.com/search/88b64ed603df1145e41cbe10bc42fe7f5942cc05?page=1&sort=score&order=desc) shows that this image has been around since at least 2010, maybe 2009. It seems it is commonly used to illustrate the symptoms of Kawasaki's ( which is interesting since the Ukranian article is about Coxsackie aka hand foot and mouth disease, but the Ukranian spelling of \u041a\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043a\u0456 is somewhat similiar to Kawasaki...) \n\nThe fact this occurs at 1:00 into [this news story](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/kids-hospitalized-with-mystery-illness-possibly-tied-to-covid-19/#x) right between a literal text book image of Kawasaki's while saying \"it resemble's Kawasaki's disease\" and a New York City Health Department Alert saying the new syndrome has \"features of Kawasaki disease\" makes me think CBS was just trying to let parent's what to look out for in reference to what the NYC Health alert said based on the description of the new syndrome in the alert. In fact it appears the only journalists who got anything wrong here were the  Ukranian ones who used a picture of the wrong disease in an article", "created_utc": 1590364800.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "frpw7iw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gpv45x", "parent_id": "t3_gpv45x", "score": 12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_frpw7iw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/gpv45x/they_did_it_again_cbs_caught_using_photo_from/frpw7iw/"}
