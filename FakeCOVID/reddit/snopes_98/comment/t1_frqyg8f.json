That said, it's not hard to see why this might be the case, nor would it be necessarily unexpected for some number of cases of of Kawasaki-like syndrome to manifest with COVID-19.  A study did find that COVID-19 actually does infect blood vessel tissue in the lungs, and it is almost certain that some number of cases of Kawasaki are caused by COVID-19 through an adverse reaction and severe inflammation in the tissue of the blood vessel.  Again, this is likely pretty rare because it's something that doesn't typically happen even when blood vessels get infected, but it's practically a guarantee that anything that can infect blood vessels will inevitably cause some number of Kawasaki-syndrome cases to occur.  It's just a matter of statistical inevitability once the mechanism for doing so is known.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean all the children will get it.  Frankly, it's probably rare. But it is a statistical inevitability that anything that can infect the blood vessels will cause some cases of Kawasaki-like syndrome, and it's probably good practice for parents to at least be aware that this could be a potential complication, if for no other reason than having a better idea when to seek prompt treatment.", "created_utc": 1590391823.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "frqyg8f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gpv45x", "parent_id": "t1_frqwrld", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1590402075.0, "name": "t1_frqyg8f", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/gpv45x/they_did_it_again_cbs_caught_using_photo_from/frqyg8f/"}
