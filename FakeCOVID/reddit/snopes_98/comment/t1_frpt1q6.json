Especially here on Reddit. We are just supposed to blindly believe and follow every order given without question otherwise you a) don\u2019t believe in \u201cscience\u201d & b) don\u2019t care if people die. \n\nDay 63ish of a 14 day shutdown to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d; the economy is tanked, record high unemployment, so much political blame flying, trillions in a stimulus that I can only imagine a few years down the road we will discover was so rife with fraud and theft it will make any rational and sane person sick. Apparently with more stimulus to follow.... And the only place that dissent isn\u2019t shouted down and ostracized is a sub with a post about a major news network outright fabricating information about this to stir up more fear and panic. As of now, there are 10 comments here. This should be everywhere, but it\u2019s not. Why? \n\nAm I losing my fucking mind? Did I somehow get sucked into an alternate universe where everyone is a brain dead drone blindly following the \u201cleaders\u201d in this Orwellian hellscape?
