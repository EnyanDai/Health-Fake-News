I can\u2019t believe it 500k!!! People we did it!\n\nThe American Revolution, against the British, was only 3-10% of the population. That's really all we need to be successful\n\n>A simple google search reveals that the population of the Thirteen Colonies in 1776 was ~2.5 million. Three percent would be 75,000. Even a cursory look at wikipedia's entry on the Revolutionary War, mentions that over 250,000 men fought as regulars or militiamen at some point during the conflict, although the standing size of the Continental Army never exceeded 90,000.\n\n>My guess is that someone took the size of the Continental Army at some point in the conflict when it was roughly 75,000 and divided that into 2.5 million and came up with the figure of only 3% of Americans fought. In reality, the percentage would be closer to 10% and as others have stated, that doesn't account for who was actually being counted in the 2.5 million total, or who was capable and willing to fight based on gender, age, race, etc.", "created_utc": 1589663012.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fquqgh5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gl0q58", "parent_id": "t1_fquf2xx", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fquqgh5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/gl0q58/italian_government_call_for_arrest_of_bill_gates/fquqgh5/"}
