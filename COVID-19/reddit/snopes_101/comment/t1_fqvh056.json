Although the SARS death rate was higher than Covid,  Covid has already claimed more lives. SARS was easier to control as symptoms were easy to identify and\u00a0thus stop the spread.\n\nThe piece under the video oddly suggests that the death rate is confined to the old just like flu so it is ok!? The two are not comparable for a number of reasons. It is more serious illness than the seasonal flu. There is many vaccines and anti viral treatments for flu but none for COVID-19. COVID-19 is also more infectious than the flu and has a higher death rate and a higher rate of hospitalisations. Bottom line so far from research is that COVID-19 spreads more easily and has a higher death rate than the flu.\n\nIt's questions what is going on but doesn't offer any answers backed by evidence. Just opinions and more rehtoric, suggesting exploitation, of what and why it doesn't give any reason. Just that it's a some sort of mystery. It's no mystery. The disease is caused by the new coronavirus. It isn\u2019t the first threatening disease that has surged around the world and will not be the last.\n\nIt mentions that all the 'data' indicates its not major threat to the world community. What data? This is a empty statement. We can see from the reasons above it is and why\u00a0countries have and continue to lockdown.\n\nAt the very end it suggests that Bill Gates has a motivate to depopulate the world with a vaccine. This statement makes no sense. Bill Gates is a philanthropists that has donated billions to charitable causes for global health (including Ebola, Polio and malaria), education, and poverty. \n\nIt is a unsubstantiated opinion with bogus parallels and no facts.", "created_utc": 1589677074.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fqvh056", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gl0qnx", "parent_id": "t1_fqupnxn", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sh5g", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fqvh056", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/metacanada/comments/gl0qnx/italian_government_call_for_arrest_of_bill_gates/fqvh056/"}
