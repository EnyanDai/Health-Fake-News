I am not a US person, so I did not know it\u2019s not a credible source, I apologize for that! TIL!)\n\nApparently, there have been multiple iterations on the book, and in 2008 Dean Koontz did change it with regard to the virus. It used to originate from Gorki (a city in Russia), and this was changed for Wuhan.\n\nThis makes sense because there is a virology institute there (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology). Also, in 2008 Wuhan starting appearing in the news because of the 2008 Summer Olympics which was held in China. \n\nI personally believe all this is a logical explanation for the fact expressed in this post. Dean heard about Wuhan, did some research, and decided it would be more fitting for the book.", "created_utc": 1582158478.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fi5a9sy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_f6ka8c", "parent_id": "t3_f6ka8c", "score": 79, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2t3lf", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1582189070.0, "name": "t1_fi5a9sy", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracytheories/comments/f6ka8c/1981_dean_koontz_noveleerily_depicting_a_similar/fi5a9sy/"}
