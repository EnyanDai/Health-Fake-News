Viruses are tiny and a lot of things are happening in your body constantly so in the time it takes between exposing yourself by contaminating your mouth and being able to make a batch of warm salt water, the contamination will have likely spread a bit beyond the reach of the concoction by means of breathing. You'd be better off to decontaminate your hands before touching your mouth.\n\n>  Edit: this is also legitimate advice \n\nNo, it is not. There is not a single sentence in this post that is factual. Additionally the part that claims that this \"eliminates the virus\" takes this from being simply useless and elevates it to being absolutely dangerous.\n\n> However, salt and vinegar do have anti microbial properties \n\nThis is true but only in certain conditions. It's important to understand when and how these things work to understand is they would help or not. \n\nSalt is considered to be antimicrobial since it's a desiccant, meaning it pulls the water out of a microbe and kills it. Mixing salt with water negates this effect. For proof, look to the ocean; too salty for humans to drink but 90% of the biomass there is microbes.\n\nVinegar is considered to be antimicrobial since it's acidic(2-3pH). However, diluting it with water, which is neutral(7pH), makes the pH of the mixture get closer to neutral with greater ratios of water to vinegar resulting in it being less effective at killing microbes.\n\n> pathogens into our stomach to kill them daily\n\nAlso true, but this virus has proven to take root in the lungs and disrupt the body's ability to expectorate the mucus so the viral presence that's causing the damage is unaffected by stomach acid since it is never introduced to it.\n\nAll in all, if the virus gets into your body, it's too late; you're infected.
