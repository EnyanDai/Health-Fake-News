It won't help much if your breathe corona in but it'll help sterilise your mouth from any unwanted bacterial. Essentially it'll help prevent you from contracting corona.\n\nSay you touch your mouth with your hands, gargling could help eliminate whatever made it into your mouth (whatever made it into your mouth goes down your esophagus where there's a little flap that separates the esophagus/trachea from the bronchial tubes of the lungs.)\n\nTLDR; for those that think that gargling salt water and vinegar is insanepeoplefacebook, this isn't a treatment. It'll help prevent you from getting sick\n\nEdit: this is also legitimate advice. While I'm not sure about whether corona lasts in the throat but if it does, washing it down into the stomach where the gastric acid can kill it (gastric acid is one our bodies many defences) and gargling with proper antiseptic definitely help eliminate pathogenic microbes from the throat. \n\nPlease don't dismiss advice because you think it's stupid and label it as insane because it really isn't. It can potentially prevent you or someone from contracting corona~~\n\nEdit2: I feel like an idiot now. There is no evidence suggesting it'll prevent corona or cure it. However, salt and vinegar do have anti microbial properties and salt and vinegar are harmless enough that practicing this probably won't hurt you. With how scary corona seems to be I still say it's worth doing.\n\nEdit3: additionally we swallow mucous containing all sorts of pathogens into our stomach to kill them daily. Surely following this advice isn't that insane.", "created_utc": 1585056580.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fld4uh3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fk6ujf", "parent_id": "t3_fk6ujf", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3acf2", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585058140.0, "name": "t1_fld4uh3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/fk6ujf/gargling_with_warm_water_salt_or_vinegar/fld4uh3/"}
