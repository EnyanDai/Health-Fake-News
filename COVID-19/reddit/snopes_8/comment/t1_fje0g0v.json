People touch their faces without knowing it all the time. If you get the virus on your hands from one of those things you mentioned, minutes later you will already have touched your face, meaning that you will already have got infected. So, does it really matter if the virus is on your phone or not? \n\nI know the virus can stay on the phone screen, but it will only get there if you got it on your hands. If you get it on your hands it won\u2019t take you long to get it on your face. \n\nThe only time I can see it making a difference is if you don\u2019t touch your face that often and if you wash your hands very often. Which is like 1% of us.\n\nI really don\u2019t see how those cases are similar at all, especially if you don\u2019t share your phone anyone with I imagine is what most people do.", "created_utc": 1583262793.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fje0g0v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fcwfqt", "parent_id": "t1_fjdvjv2", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1583263061.0, "name": "t1_fje0g0v", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fcwfqt/dirty_banknotes_may_be_spreading_the_coronavirus/fje0g0v/"}
