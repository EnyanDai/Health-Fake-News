It's like there's now a large number of innocently naive people on reddit who browse facebook/Instagram/front page of reddit and take everything as true, but never dive deeper or question stuff.\n\nThe gallowboob post the other day of the newborn twins holding hands for example. Loads of replies were people replying to him as though he was the mother and telling him how beautiful his babies are lol\n\nAnother good one for your point about sarcasm was the post that did the rounds yesterday with the sikh guy in India who took 60 people to safety on his motorbike. Someone made the obvious joke question of asking how he fitted 60 people on his bike at one time, and there were earnest replies telling them that he took them one at a time because they thought he was seriously asking))\n\nI honestly think there are almost 2 reddits now. There's the r/all casual skimmer who thinks reddit is awww, pics and politics, and the more jaded user who only browses their subscribed subs and never sees r/all. When either of them venture into the other's domain it's jarringly different.", "created_utc": 1582980353.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fj3e4jg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fb0djb", "parent_id": "t1_fj1y5bh", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fj3e4jg", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fb0djb/north_koreas_first_confirmed_coronavirus_covid_19/fj3e4jg/"}
