There is absolutely no instructions out there as to what to do.  If people shouldn't be going on cruises, why are there cruises allowed to go?  The President doesn't look concerned.  Most of the \"real\" action being taken is people and companies just acting independently.  It isn't hard to see how in the face of a bunch of people running around with minimal direction, and no clear word from the government that you should be freaking out, some people just assume it is nonsense.  \n\nIt's going to take clear government orders before people start doing stuff.  This sort of disaster is why we have an elect government.  This is collective national defense.  Our government is failing to lead that defense.  It's confusing and leading to different people having entirely different reactions.\n\nYeah, people need to be better, but in this wretched time of mass disinformation and partisan bullshit, I have a hard time being angry at people who can't separate out fact from reality.  Hell, I'm not even sure I actually understand the situation and what exactly I should be doing.", "created_utc": 1584256704.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjrr9p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjffwa", "score": 12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjrr9p", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjrr9p/"}
