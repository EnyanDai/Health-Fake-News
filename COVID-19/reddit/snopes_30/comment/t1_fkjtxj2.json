Meaning they won't have to be hospitalized. This does not mean it will be just a caught. You can be considered mild and still be seriously ill. \n\nHalf of the \"mild\" cases could be left with scarred lungs. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/cHSzkCfP208\n\nEven if you don't die your body could still be permently damaged. Damage that could lead to other issues that kill you later or reduce your life span. Or just have a negative impact on your quality of life. \n\nMaybe you won't be able to play your favorite sport like you used to or Chase your kids or dog around.\n\nMaybe you didn't take it seriously and didn't isolate so you spread it to a loved one. \n\nIf 80% of cases are \"mild\" then 20% aren't. \n\nThat is 1 in 5.\n\n1 in 5 that will need to be hospitalized or they will die.\n\nOur health care system can not handle this. The regular old flu sometimes has hospitals maxed out. This is going to get real fucking bad.\n\n\nThe first person to die in Italy was a 30 something athlete. \n\nEven if you don't die directly from the coronavirus people who need health care for other issues will die because the resources that could've saved them are used up.\n\nThis will also destory a lot of peoples lives from financial stress. \n\nNot to mention grief and mental health issues from trauma and things like survivers guilt.\n\nEveryone is going to know someone that died from this.\n\nThere are people who are trapped inside with their dead loved ones rotting bodies.\n\nThat's gonna cause extreme mental torment and health issues. \n\nLife is going to be weird for a long time and things will never be the same again.", "created_utc": 1584259512.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjtxj2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjgk77", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjtxj2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjtxj2/"}
