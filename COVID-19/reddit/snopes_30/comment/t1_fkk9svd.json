I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with people who react that way. \n\nMy mom is a NICU nurse. I typically visit her at work to bring her lunch and eat with her once a month and I stopped in January when news broke of corona. Mostly because my mom asked me to because I work in an office and my boss just got back from China. (He does not have the virus but better safe)\n\nThey started screening parents before they let them in. Yesterday she found out one of her babies parents didn\u2019t test positive for corona but had a high fever so both were told to go home. She told me she could hear the mom crying from inside the NICU. It\u2019s heartbreaking. She\u2019s also heard people banging on the doors of the NICU to get in after being rejected. She called me crying about it yesterday and said she was holding those babies a little extra this week. \n\nOn top of that she is also self isolating to keep her patients safe. Which for the extreme extrovert that my mom is, is very hard for her. If I would have witnessed that grandma shit talking the staff I probably would have told her off.
