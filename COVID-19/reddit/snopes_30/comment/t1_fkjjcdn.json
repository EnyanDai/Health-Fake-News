My dad is 73 and I got into a huge fight with him yesterday because he doesn't need to work but still does to keep his mind and body occupied. I told him tell your boss you don't want to come in for the next 2 weeks. He said he'll be fine and wasn't worried. 73 year old who still smokes and has been doing so for 50 years. He will DIE if he gets it. Luckily he did take my advise and his boss totally understands. They probably don't want to pay him cause I'm sure their business is suffering. I'm trying to avoid all unnecessary trips to stores but I had to fax something very important today and it was just me and one other person in Staples. No one is going out, shopping. Shit is real and going to get even more real in the coming days and weeks, possibly months.", "created_utc": 1584247713.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjjcdn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkizcx9", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjjcdn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjjcdn/"}
