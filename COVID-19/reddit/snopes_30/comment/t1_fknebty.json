We have him because the first party \"5 Stars Movement\" backstabbed an entire country.\n\nItaly is left alone by the EU which doesn't give a shit. Conte first let the illness to spread all over the country with his total negligence and then made everyone get stuck home with a nation-wide 24/h curfew as if we lived in a totalitatian police state, and guess what, he's acting like he's an hero and compared himself as Churchill. Spain and France are following Italy's totalitarian example, i heard.\n\nRecently, our semi-communist government sent rags with holes as masks, and they're also blocking the creation of a provisional hospital in Milan because the italian Civil Protection (a government body) can't send ventilators to this hospital. Bureaucratic bullshit, also.\n\nAll these hard times Italy and the EU is living is the direct results of flawed **socialist** policies, of cuts to important resources and of EU-imposed **austerity** in order to favor the big banks to the detriment of citizens and general wealth.\n\nThis is why you should NEVER vote for extremist parties, both left and right (the right wing opposition isn't communicating very well). And in this case we have a **far-left political force** ruling our country. They're all scumbags with no coscience who are deliberately destroying a country just to not leave their overpaid job as parliament members. Serious politicians would have already resigned, but these are really attached to power and money.\n\nAnd the people bitch about Trump and BoJo (and i believe the Die Welt news about Trump wanting to buy the vaccine for exclusive american use is full of shit and not to be believed until more accurate sources come out). While you can have doubts or criticize these figures, the EU has literally no right to do that, because they're the directly rensponsible of all this tragedy, and what's worse is that in the EU they will never be held accountable for this. This is madness.\n\nThis is not fair. Italy is a first world country and the World might hold these evil assholes accountable for these incredible issues, but this is **how a totalitarian police state** is created.\n\nAgain, \"Giuseppi\" Conte is an evil, unelected and communist piece of shit. And to think the 5 Stars Movement selected him as PM, the 5 Stars are evil cowardly scumbags too.", "created_utc": 1584363463.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fknebty", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fjfdnq", "parent_id": "t3_fjfdnq", "score": 42, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3400v", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584389244.0, "name": "t1_fknebty", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/kotakuinaction2/comments/fjfdnq/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fknebty/"}
