{"author": {}, "body": "There is private healthcare in Italy as well just like in the USA. You already pay for public healthcare, but you just can't use it. In fact you pay MORE for public healthcare than Italy already. The difference is that just because you aren't covered by public healthcare, you think you aren't paying for it. There doesn't even need to be a virus for you to be denied the public healthcare that you are paying for. And in Italy they still get healthcare, this is about ICU only. \n\n **AND there STILL are enough ICU beds availabdle regardless. At least as of now. This isn't a problem of healthcare systems. EVery single healthcare system can become overburdened by this no matter how it's paid for.**", "created_utc": 1584292622.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkkv6rw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjk3ki", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584311487.0, "name": "t1_fkkv6rw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkkv6rw/"}
