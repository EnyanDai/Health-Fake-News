We are lucky enough to have the people and technology to keep people alive well past their natural expiration date. This virus is unfortunate, but people want to be there to help.\n\nThere is a level of callousness about it. Your job is to do what you can. It\u2019s not to save everyone. It\u2019s not to do everything right all the time. If you work in any profession long enough you are going to fuck up. It\u2019s no different in medicine. Part of being in a serious profession is being ready for the reality of people dying and that you will be responsible. It\u2019s part of the job.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't wish on anybody the responsibility to have to.... blah blah\u201d\n\nTruth is there are people who step up because they know that if they don\u2019t, nobody will. So appreciate them.
