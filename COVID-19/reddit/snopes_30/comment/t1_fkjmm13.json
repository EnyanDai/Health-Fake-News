I know it's beyond difficult, but taking moments to just breathe can be helpful. \n\nAs for your kids - do they have any friends whose parents are working from home or otherwise staying home with them? If they do those parents may be willing to watch your kids as well. If not, speak with your babysitters. If babysitting your kids won't require them to overly expose themselves they might still be okay with it. If, for example, they stay in the house then that should be fine. Walks around the neighborhood would be fine, too. Just don't ask them to take the kids somewhere where there might be a crowd - a restaurant, the mall, etc.\n\nBest of luck to you! It's a difficult time, but I'm sure you and your family will make it. :)", "created_utc": 1584250858.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjmm13", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjl7yh", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjmm13", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjmm13/"}
