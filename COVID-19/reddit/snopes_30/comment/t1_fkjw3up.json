You literally don't know you have it, and by the time you know you've probably already infected two others.\n\nI don't know where you're living, but unless it's China or mainland Europe then you haven't even begun to have your life shut down yet. In Italy people are literally confined to their houses unless they have approval to leave for urgent matters.\n\nI agree with keeping the vulnerable safe and with expanding hospital capacity, both those things are happening as we speak. In fact it seems that the UK government's new plans (after their original \"Let's just all catch the diseases and get it over with it\" approach was panned) is likely to be exactly that. They're talking of quarantining all over 70s to their homes for 4 months whilst telling all manufacturers to pivot to building respirators.\n\n But unless you have a way of locking all elderly and vulnerable people completely away from the rest of us then we all have to try and limit the spread as well.", "created_utc": 1584262367.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjw3up", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjvqg0", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjw3up", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjw3up/"}
