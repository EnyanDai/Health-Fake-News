The time to lock down is YESTERDAY. \n\nI\u2019m in Seattle and I\u2019m in voluntary quarantine when I\u2019m not at work in my primary care clinic. I am not going to Starbucks or the library, when I go to the store it\u2019s at 3am and I\u2019m keeping a distance from everyone else. This virus would 100% kill my dad, who has COPD. I haven\u2019t seen him in person in 3 weeks and won\u2019t for probably at least a few more months. He\u2019s locked in his house, my brother is leaving groceries on the porch. \n\nI see people dining out or working on laptops in Starbucks and it drives me crazy. If I need to choose between the survival of my elderly patients and loved ones and the pleasure of a meal out/economic stimulus, I\u2019ll lock myself away with Netflix for however long it takes. \n\nIf you are not extremely concerned about this, then your head is in the sand. I don\u2019t want people to panic but I do want them to take this seriously.", "created_utc": 1584251331.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjn2i6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t3_fisiy7", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjn2i6", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjn2i6/"}
