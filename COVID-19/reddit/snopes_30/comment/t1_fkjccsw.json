What's wrong with you? There's no blame to apportion, this is merely a question of provision.  \nGiven the last time this happened was over a hundred years ago there is no need to have the spare capacity required for this extremely rare event, it wouldn't survive a single budget assessment at any point during that century.  \nThe issue is bursty traffic. The ICU units at hospitals are like a quiet village road that is suddenly having all NYC traffic pushed through it. Nobody is to blame, its just a shitty problem that demonstrates the fragility of elements of our civilisation. We provide the capacity we need but if some freak event occurs that massively exceeds that quota its very hard to ramp up quickly to accommodate it.", "created_utc": 1584241920.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjccsw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkj94gw", "score": -3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjccsw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjccsw/"}
