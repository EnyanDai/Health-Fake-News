Voters only have as much power as the system they're a part of, and the system is designed to support those who control the money. \n\nFor the sake of the country, these people need to put the American Citizen first. A way for this to happen, for example, could be to put a ceiling on personal wealth while still encouraging said person to keep generating money. But that's not something the average citizen can convince a m/billionaire to do. We certainly can't vote for it, either. They kind of need to decide to do that by themselves.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I completely agree that voting now is more important than ever. But ultimately, the people in power need to work for *us*, not just uses us to get where they need to be to push their own agendas. And that requires it to put every citizen first. Not just every citizen *that can afford it.* \n\nThe way it is now, in a nation-wide crisis that's only *slightly* worse than how I think this one will shake out, none of that will matter. Our economy will collapse, followed by the federal government. Maybe some local governments will act fast and prevail. But people will certainly never trust the \"United States\" ever again. And that's the key, isn't it? Trust in our leaders. That trust is very shaken right now. And they need to act fast and smart, but most importantly, they need to be transparent.\n\n\n\nSorry, this is all kind of a rant. \u270c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude02 Just freeballing some thoughts, feel free to keep it going or just smile and nod \ud83d\ude0b", "created_utc": 1584247304.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjivt3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjh0uk", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584247503.0, "name": "t1_fkjivt3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjivt3/"}
