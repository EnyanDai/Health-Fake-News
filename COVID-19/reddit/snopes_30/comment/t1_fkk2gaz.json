But I think the difference between what is happening here and in Italy is that the infection was being spread amongst the population before they isolated the everyone. The people who have died were already infected before the lockdown, the Italian lockdown is to prevent even more infection and death. \n\nFor the UK government's isolation of only the vulnerable to work, it has to be implemented before the virus is established in our population, and particularly before it has arrived in care homes etc. And the other mitigations that have been revealed today about extra beds and ventilators need to work. And they need to solve the staffing problem. \n\nWhat I'm saying is it could work. They better get a wiggle on though.
