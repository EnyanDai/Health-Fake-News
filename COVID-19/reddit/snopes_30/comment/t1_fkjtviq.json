They took out his ventilator, gave him a mask with oxygen flow that was not enough to sustain him and I sat up all night with grandma and listened to him gasp for air. He was not conscious the last few hours and he was on a pain medication drip and had a DNR on file.\n\nThey can and will just load you up with pain medication and let you go. There was no level of care that could save him and he was in pain. Wristband said don't bring me back. They removed all treatment bar an oxygen mask that made it less bad and his morphine trip. Took out his permanent feeding tube and took off all monitors but his heart beat so he had less wires and machines when we said goodbye and I'd of left except my mom wasn't leaving my grandma and I knew she did not want to watch him go so I stayed for them.\n\nIt happens every day. Sometimes do no harm means you let them go in as little pain as possible.", "created_utc": 1584259439.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjtviq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjmt8e", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjtviq", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjtviq/"}
