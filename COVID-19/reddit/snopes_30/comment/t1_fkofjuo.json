They live in Sicily and the medical system there is pure shit before the Wuhan flu came. I witnessed it with my own two eyes on a number of occasions when I lived there. Her Grandpa about 10 years ago when he was in his mid 80's had a medical condition that they couldn't figure out and the doctor told him \"you're in gods hands now\". Now my wife's uncle is a doctor (also Sicilian) but lived in Brussels working pulled some strings and got him up to the north in Milan and got him taken care of before he died. \n\nHe's still alive, but barely right now. His wife is in her 80's now and is in the latter end of health too. My FIL had a heart attack a year ago and I'm fucking terrified about this right now because in their village there was two confirmed cases of Winnie the flu and I know how shit the hospitals are. \n\nI can share pictures of the \"hospital\". You'd get better service by going to a high school nurse in the US.", "created_utc": 1584386210.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkofjuo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fjjs2m", "parent_id": "t3_fjjs2m", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkofjuo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fjjs2m/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkofjuo/"}
