I have a friend with 4 kids that is paying around $1000 a month for basic coverage with a fairly large deductible. That's with the employer covering half the cost for the employee and nothing for the dependents. Heck, I'm single and I pay $300+ a month in insurance. \n\nI dont think alot of Americans actually realize what the cost of health care is for other Americans and that's it's not a blanket expense. For how much we pay in taxes and insurance, we are getting robbed. We dont get crap. That's the argument for universal health care. No it's not perfect and there are issues with public healthcare, but if the average american is getting 30-40% of their paycheck sliced off the top why should we have then pay more for deductibles and other services our health insurance just choose to not cover.", "created_utc": 1584546203.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkubg14", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fjtjuh", "parent_id": "t1_fkq16a4", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3fuwj", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584546481.0, "name": "t1_fkubg14", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskThe_Donald/comments/fjtjuh/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkubg14/"}
