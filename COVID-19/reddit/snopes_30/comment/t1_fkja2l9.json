The article in the post, was the source of their statement. I provided the source for their words. It was not my personal report on what is and isn't happening. This is nothing more than that.\n\nTruly, I'm not naysaying that shit has officially hit the fan in Italy. I did recently read the personal account of Cristina Higgins from Bergamo whose statement was verified. I'm with you on that. Just responded to a specific question about a specific statement, that's all.\n\nThe article is behind a paywall. The first two paragraphs state their plan for if there are not enough beds go around. To the people quoting reports of triage, etc.. many of us cannot see that part because of the paywall.\n\nBut, if you would like to report to people that yes, it is happening.. this is a good source for that. Because many people, like me, won't be able to see the part you quoted in the article linked.
