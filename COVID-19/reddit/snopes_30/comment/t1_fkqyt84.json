Like I said, I pay about 3k per year for me and my kids\u2019 insurance. If suddenly my tax bill is 6k higher, we\u2019ll look at that, it\u2019s less than 10k! So they saved me 4K according to Bernie math! But they didn\u2019t. \n\nAnd all this is pretty much besides the point because the assumptions that the M4A costs are built on, are probably not true. For instance, Medicare negotiates rates with providers to get shit cheaper. They pay a fraction of what insurance pays and as a result a shitload of providers just don\u2019t accept it. They\u2019re not forced to provide a service for X dollars, if they can\u2019t keep the doors open for that amount they just say no. M4A projections assume Medicare rates across the board. So all these providers will either accept that low rate or shut their doors. \n\nAnd M4A could never be passed, this is the funniest part of the Bernie bro\u2019s lack of depth. It\u2019s projected to cost as much as the entire government spends *right now*. Literally doubles the national tax burden and budget. It costs 6x what we spend on the entire military. 6x! Do you see congress passing a law that doubles the budget? How long do you think that government shutdown would last?", "created_utc": 1584458448.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkqyt84", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fjtjuh", "parent_id": "t1_fkqx6hh", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3fuwj", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkqyt84", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskThe_Donald/comments/fjtjuh/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkqyt84/"}
