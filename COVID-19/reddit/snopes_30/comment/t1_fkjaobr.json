Under normal conditions, you rarely see things go out of stock. There are busy days, yes, but most of the time the food coming in equals food coming out because people do their shopping on different days of the week and you have time to order in more and restock.\n\nCoronavirus is the weatherman saying bad weather is coming and suddenly, everyone is at the store. There are the normal people who are there getting their stuff for the week, but now everyone else getting emergency supplies. The store can't handle that many people and suddenly the store is stripped of the staples that people need.\n\nOnly for hospitals it's even worse because there aren't a whole lot of ventilators to go around in the first place. There usually isn't a huge need for vast quantities of them. If for some reason they were all in use and a patient needed one, you would just send them to another hospital to use theirs. Now, you can't do that because the other hospitals are also full.", "created_utc": 1584240629.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjaobr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkj99mx", "score": 17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjaobr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjaobr/"}
