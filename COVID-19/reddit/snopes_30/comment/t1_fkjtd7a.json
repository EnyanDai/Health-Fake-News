True that these also predominantly have comorbidities that they would eventually die from, but not nearly as quickly.  I don\u2019t like the argument that \u2018just as many (or more) people die every day from the flu/ heart disease/ car accidents\u2019 because this is *in addition* to all of those deaths, not replacing them.  Also, I haven\u2019t researched stats on the flu when it first came to be, but we have to remember that covid-19 is not yet established.  It\u2019s just starting out and spreading rapidly and causing many deaths.  \n\nHospitals in the US already work at full capacity while being short staffed.  It will not take a lot to push us over the edge.  Young healthcare workers in other countries are getting infected and dying while wearing full PPE and freaking hazmat suits and we are running out of N95 and standard masks before we have even really been hit.  \n\nSo yes, we should be concerned.  Of course we are not going to eradicate the virus, but we can and should take reasonable measures to slow the spread until we can get a vaccine on the market.", "created_utc": 1584258786.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjtd7a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjrhcj", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjtd7a", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjtd7a/"}
