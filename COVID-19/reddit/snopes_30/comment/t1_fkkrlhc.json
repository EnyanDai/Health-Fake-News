Not only is healthcare a human right, it's also not a means of production. Comparing countries like France and Germany to Venezuela is just dishonest.\n\nOur current system is high suseptable to corruption so no change there.\n\nIf you really want to get into Bernie Sanders, then fine. He's 78 and has worked in a high paying government position for decades. His first home is his primary residence. They have a mortgage and it's worth about $400K. It is by no means a mansion. The second is an apartment in DC. Again, not a mansion, on a mortgage and worth around $550K. The third, which they purchased using inheritance money, a small 2 bedroom lakefront house. This house is also in the $550K range. Considering he's at retirement age and still earning $174K a year this is not exactly unexpected. The only thing Bernie has done that could even be construed as out of the ordinary for a relatively normal upper-middle-class family is write a book, which sold well. Not that it matters, because his personal net worth doesn't change facts. This type of healthcare is cheaper overall for the general population and the majority of those within it.\n\n>You are telling me that I should trust YOU who can't even empathize\n\nCognitive dissonance right there.\n\n>I should trust that YOU have the empathy to ensure that healthcare for all is administered fairly after the money is taken from our hands each month.\n\nIt uses the exact same triage system, and doesn't discriminate. Meanwhile, for profit systems want to deny insurance for pre-existing conditions, denying cancer treatment to someone because they had a cold when they bought the insurance. Tell me how that's empathetic, why I should trust unaccountable businesses not to sacrifice human life for their bottom dollar.", "created_utc": 1584290470.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkkrlhc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkkog9n", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkkrlhc", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkkrlhc/"}
