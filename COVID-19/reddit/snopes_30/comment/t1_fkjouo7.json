Many don't have it and they still recieve care even if poor, the hospitals don't turn you away they just send you a bill and a payment plan and often times they even cut down the bill significantly if you tell them you can't pay. Again all of that is irrelevant as the point stands on it's own, you don't have to have insurance. I am 28 and have never had it and won't be getting left to die at 80 years old for something I paid for \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAlso you are correct insurance agencies are just socialized healthcare that isn't government mandated by law (and ultimately threat of death as death is at the end of all law). It is a beautiful thing capitalism. Capitalism is a liberty. If socialized programs work you are absolutely free to establish them voluntarily. Where as in a socialist society socialism is a law and capitalism is a crime.", "created_utc": 1584253289.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjouo7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjoef2", "score": -5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjouo7", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjouo7/"}
