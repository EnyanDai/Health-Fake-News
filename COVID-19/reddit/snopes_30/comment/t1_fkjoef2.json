Your insurance payments are the same as taxes. You pay for something if you use it or not, except Americans pay around double other countries. A triage system would work the same way, so if they refuse to see you, you would be paying your insurance premiums but be unable to use the insurance due to no hospitals accepting you.\n\nWhat's worse, just to get triaged they may charge you $1,000.\n\nWhat's even worse, even if they do see you they may charge thousands for in network care, or tens of thousands for out of network.\n\nSo the only difference between the possible fallout of Italy if their healthcare does get overstressed, and the US hospitals getting overworked, is that after the US hospitals refuse to treat the 80 year olds, they then charge said 80 year olds for seeing a nurse in the emergency room to tell them to go home. God forbid they take an ambulance. A couple of thousand dollars to get the same advise people in Italy can get for far less.", "created_utc": 1584252778.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjoef2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjnr0a", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjoef2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjoef2/"}
