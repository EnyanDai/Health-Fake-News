Just the fact that you don't know that the mortality of 7% Is due to the way the italian healt minister choose to consider people that died (WITH Sars-CoV2 and not BECAUSE OF the virus) is a prove that no matter how much sources you bring you would still understand nothing. \n\nIn most of the other coutries they are counting people that died BECAUSE OF coronavirus (Germany for example).\n\nAbout the second source you bring there is nothing official, medics (besides 2-3 hospitals) don't have to choose who to treat (these 2-3 hospitals are in the very first places where the virus hit so where it hit harder). They are just saying that they hope the situation will improve and our government finally did the right thing, probably just in time.\n\nI will bring you all the sources you need tomorrow man.\n\nIn future if you don't understand/know well enough a thing just STFU because all you said is just bullshit.", "created_utc": 1584245863.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjh95a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjg9r3", "score": -7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjh95a", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjh95a/"}
