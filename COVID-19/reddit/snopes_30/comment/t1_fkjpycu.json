That's it. That's what you are when you're at the workplace. Is letting people die immoral or wrong? That's debatable. It's like the threads posted awhile back about Mexican women being killed and abused.\n\nWell they only make up 10% of homicide victims. Statistically speaking, the government should let them get raped and killed and spend money on the 90% instead. It's for the greater good, just like letting old people die is for the greater good because they are statistically worthless and insignificant (like Mexican women). Do you think its immoral for people in power (government here) to let a subset of the population get killed innocently given good intentions? Letting those women die in favor of saving people that are worth more to society is basically what it is. Letting old people die because younger ones are worth more is the same deal. I think it's a necessity and that we should encourage it. But I'm sure you can understand why some people would not.\n\nBut I think that it's perfectly ok. And I think that what medical workers do is ok too because I'm not a hypocrite.\n\nBut if you disagree with the above scenario, then you're a hypocrite and a moron with no spine.", "created_utc": 1584254531.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjpycu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjngcu", "score": -2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584254937.0, "name": "t1_fkjpycu", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjpycu/"}
