Then things get *really* bad.  \n\nAnd, well. People not being able to feed their family if they have to isolate themselves for the public good for two weeks is part of the ongoing structural problems we have here in the US. \n\nI hope a bunch more people don't end up dying because of the choices we as a country have made. \n\nIf you have to go out, *please* take all the steps you can to protect yourself and your family (which it sounds like you're doing).", "created_utc": 1584248641.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkjkcjv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fisiy7", "parent_id": "t1_fkjgiyk", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkjkcjv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fisiy7/italians_over_80_will_be_left_to_die_as_country/fkjkcjv/"}
