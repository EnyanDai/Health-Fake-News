This algorithm is based on rapid sorting. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s supporting a family of 6 or who runs a small business. It\u2019s literally based on medical sorting/needs/triage. I know nothing about home life. When we run drills the triage tag  will say\n\n \u201c38 yo F chest wound, BP60/20, HR 36, RR 8\u201d \n\n\u201c45 yo M compound open femur fracture BP 147/79, HR 137, RR 28\u201d\n\n\u201c68 yo F blunt force trauma abd BP 100/60, HR 138, RR 26\u201d\n\nYou gotta pick who you\u2019re gonna see immediately between the three, who\u2019s getting your FIRST bed, who you can\u2019t save, but can be given comfort measures, and who can be given the *next* bed. You make that decision in 1-2 mins. I don\u2019t have the time to get into nitty gritty about their family life. Hell we don\u2019t even always know their names.\n\nEdit - except it\u2019s not 3 it\u2019s 30 patients or 70. The idea is that you\u2019re making split second decisions based on the immediate info you have and the limited resources you know your facility has. \n\nIn this case, I would give the blunt force abdominal trauma my next bed (red), the open femur fracture would be immediate (yellow) and the chest wound who\u2019s vitals are in the tank would be comfort measure (black). That\u2019s assuming I have one doctor, one bed left, one ready OR and the immediate resources to save one patient **right now**. Someone might make a different choice.
