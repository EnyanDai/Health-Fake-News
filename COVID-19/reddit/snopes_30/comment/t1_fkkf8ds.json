I'm making the same effort you are; I simply realize that if it comes down to the worst case scenario, it's better for the world if someone of greater value (younger, healthier, with a family that relies on them) gets to live.  Not (further) traumatizing healthcare workers deciding who lives and who dies is a nice bonus.\n\n>I don't like this guy being so cavalier and fatalistic, if there is something he can do to prevent it. So he's alone, and he's not married, and doesn't have kids -- he's still a human being and has worth.\n\nAgain, it's not like I'm wandering the streets looking for sick people to lick.  I'm doing the same things everyone else is doing: staying inside and washing my hands 357 times a day.  I have simply decided to let someone else live in my place *if it comes to that*.  (I'm prediabetic and prehypertensive, so the simple reality is that my chances of survival are lower than other people my age in any case.)
