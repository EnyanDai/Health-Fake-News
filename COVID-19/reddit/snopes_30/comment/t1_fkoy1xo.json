NYT and Vox are dishrags. Leftists, Trump-hating dishrags. Their hysteria has more to do with the upcoming election than anything else.\n\nI will repeat what one of your 'heroes' said not so long ago when society was breaking apart: These are hard times, not end times. This is not the black death. This is not even Spanish flu. His is H1N1--it will kill some people, it will infect millions, but is something we will get through.\n\nBut you can see all up and down this thread just how invested many on the left are in using this issue to embarass Trump. If you want conservatives to take it seriously, than your side has to, too, and just use it as a partisan cudgel.\n\nYou're a brigader.
