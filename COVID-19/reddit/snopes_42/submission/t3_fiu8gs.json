They have an episode that predicts Trump becoming president. They also have an episode that shows Trump dying, this has not came true. I know this sounds crazy but today on the new the speech going on about the coronavirus, they mentioned that trump had been in contact with 3 individuals who had tested positive for the virus. They also tested Trump, but his results weren\u2019t ready yet. They were also talking about if the result of anyone cane out negative to stay inside and not put the public at risk bc the next day you may test positive if you show symptoms. \nWhat if Trump actually has the virus, he is an older individual and his immune system is at risk. And bc he has a compromise immune system, he dies, and that\u2019s what the simpsons episode predicts, by showing his death, but not saying how. It could also be possible that he has the virus, but it wouldn\u2019t have killed him, yet the government or \u201cthey\u201d in reality poison him, and use the virus as an excuse for his death. Personally I think the first one is true. I know it sounds absolutely crazy and it might not happen at all, it was just a thought I had...a conspiracy theory. Sounds plausible. What\u2019s everyones thoughts on this?", "stickied": false}
