Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt means coordination and direction from the White House is terribly important. \u201d\n\n>The White House proposal \u201cis threatening to claw back funding whose precise purpose is to help the United States be able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis,\u201d said Carolyn Reynolds, a vice president at PATH, a global health technology nonprofit.\n\n>Collectively, warns Jeremy Konyndyk, who led foreign disaster assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Obama administration, \u201cWhat this all adds up to is a potentially really concerning rollback of progress on U.S. health security preparedness.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIt seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over the last 15 years,\u201d said Konyndyk, now a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. \u201cThese moves make us materially less safe. It\u2019s inexplicable.\u201d\n\n>The day before news of Ziemer\u2019s exit became public, one of the officials on his team, Luciana Borio, director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the NSC, spoke at a symposium at Emory University to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic. That event killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide.\n\n>\u201cThe threat of pandemic flu is the number one health security concern,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cAre we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.\u201d", "created_utc": 1584381082.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fko6jjl", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_fjp1xd", "parent_id": "t3_fjp1xd", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2uubs", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fko6jjl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/mormonpolitics/comments/fjp1xd/top_white_house_official_in_charge_of_pandemic/fko6jjl/"}
