In 2000 and in 2007, the leaders of North and South Korea met and came to peace agreements.  The North promised to end hostile activities, and the South paid millions of dollars in cash and humanitarian aid.  Even if they sign some kind of agreement, North Korea can, and probably will, do what it did the last few times -- claim some kind of grievance or break in the terms of the agreement, and then walk away.\n\nKidnapping or imprisoning foreigners for use as bargaining chips later is North Korean government standard operating procedure.  \n\nI will believe that peace between North and South is real when the border comes down, all the North Korean political prisoners are released, and the Kim Jung family dynasty gives up it's hold on power.\n\nBut again, you would have to be as gullible as Trump to believe that they would be willing to give up their power and let themselves be ruled by law.  They have too many secrets and committed too many war crimes to be able to transition to democratic rule scot free.\n\nNo, the North Koreans will soak the international community and the USA for money, and then make up some excuse to walk away.  And do you know who is going to encourage them to do it?  The people who manufacture and sell military weapons and equipment to the USA.    Just like they have done in the past.  \n\nThose who are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat it.", "created_utc": 1526093288.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "dyufm5i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8ijgli", "parent_id": "t1_dytbhtr", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9z", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_dyufm5i", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Health/comments/8ijgli/top_white_house_official_in_charge_of_pandemic/dyufm5i/"}
