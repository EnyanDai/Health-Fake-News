This has nothing to do with the actual strain on the medical resources. Everyone knows that elective surgeries are very expensive and lucrative. It's no surprise that losing that major revenue stream means that people will be furloughed. Their business is a lot like these other businesses that are closing their doors. They're not essential.\n\nAt the end of the article it even states that it's only bringing in 50% of original revenue while it is spending 120% of it's usual. Sounds more like they are working even harder than usual, but don't have the money to pay all the workers so resources are even more strained than usual.", "created_utc": 1586139068.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmjwd89", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvhf88", "parent_id": "t1_fmjoedm", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmjwd89", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fvhf88/official_counts_understate_the_us_coronavirus/fmjwd89/"}
