At least not over stuff like this. We are getting royally fucked right now-- they're trying to make encryption effectively illegal, they're misappropriating tax money in times of crises, they're giving tax cuts to the wealthy... However, there's already too much noise over the Corona Virus. Further, the country is too divided to make a difference-- funny how that works. The Obama administration saw massive partisanship and the last election served to further the divide. The impeachment set a precedent that the legislative branch, in the control of the Republicans, has stopped doing it's job of imposing checks and balances on the executive branch. There have been some good protests in the last decade over the Flynt water crises, police brutality, etc. However, those things are more tangible and local. The government controls a large portion of the media at this point; there's been billions spent on disinformation. At this point, there's no way for the US people to stop the corruption and abuse of power in the short-term. It's quite sad.", "created_utc": 1587112950.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fno5m2l", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2luoj", "parent_id": "t1_fnnl51k", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fno5m2l", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/g2luoj/over_43000_us_millionaires_will_get_stimulus/fno5m2l/"}
