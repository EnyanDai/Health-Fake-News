They will just post \u201cthis change will net millionaires 70B this year\u201d, and watch people click and go crazy.  \n\nAll this did was reverse a 80% limit on carry forward NOLs.   Not to mention the limit was just put in place 2 years ago (was no limit under Obama).   We\u2019re just back to the Obama tax law in relation to this specific policy.  \n\nTo use an example...A company lost 10M in 2019, and say they are somehow a business who did better in 2020 and they project to make 15M.  Under the recently passed 2017 TCJA they would be able to offset the 15M income with only 80% of the 10M prior year NOL.     Now they can deduct 100% of the 10M.    But it\u2019s not like the gov just gave them a 2M deduction they would have lost.   That 2M carry\u2019s forward indefinitely.   So they would have received the benefit in 2021.   This just speeds up the process and allows the business to get the benefit in 2020.", "created_utc": 1587092167.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnnh0ab", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2luoj", "parent_id": "t3_g2luoj", "score": 21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnnh0ab", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/g2luoj/over_43000_us_millionaires_will_get_stimulus/fnnh0ab/"}
