You'll get your $1200.  Youll continue to make $900 every two weeks after taxes/union/healthcare\n\nIf you work at Burger King at $12 an hour and get laid off, you will get your $1200 check **and** youll get $360 (MN UI) + $1200 (Care) every two weeks.  Your income went from $920 every two weeks to $1560.  Even if you have to find a new job, your benefits will last for 4 months.  Youll have made $5,120 **more than had you worked those four months**.  You could **literally not work for the next 4 months and still have earned more money than had you worked.**  If we add in MN Ui lasting 5 months, its an additional month with the excess cash that theyll break even.\n\nTo me -- that means **americans that are still working** get **far less benefits** than those that are laid off or furloughed.\n\nRisking yourself to give people groceries, medicine, delivery food, work at target will **get significantly less** than anyone that **isnt working**\n\nI'm not providing disinformation.  Americans that **continue to work** dont get that up to 10k you speak of, and thats absolutely bullshit -- and lets me know that neither dems nor gop care about those that are still working.\n\nIm for helping the poor.  They get $1200, I get $1200, the rich get $1200 and 1.7 million.  I pay more in taxes than those that make less, so i proportionately got less back in the rebate than them.  I dont want to work if theyre making more money that had they not worked -- on my tax dollar -- while i get shit scraps compared to them.", "created_utc": 1587091829.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnnghyp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2luoj", "parent_id": "t1_fnnfrnx", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587092626.0, "name": "t1_fnnghyp", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/g2luoj/over_43000_us_millionaires_will_get_stimulus/fnnghyp/"}
