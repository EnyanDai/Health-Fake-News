But apparently you literally didnt read anything i put in my response.  Those that are laid off **are making more money than had they not** and are make 2, 3, 4, 5x as much as I am off my tax dollars.\n\nI want to feel I get equal money, care, and compensation for working from the government.  Be it $10 off my student loans every hour I work, reduction on my taxes, federally paid PTO.  \n\nIf I dont feel like my tax dollars equally came back to me but went to the rich and the poor, I simply will keep our $2400 for my wife and I and put it into a savings account and not spend it.  I dont want to help the feds get more money off taxes of spent money if my taxes dont equally benefit me as much as those above and below me in the tax bracket.  They need to write bills and give the essential workers a break or I wont vote, its pretty simple.\n\nYou dont 'get my vote' just because youre D or R.  You get it because you give me something I want or I believe in their message.", "created_utc": 1587093925.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnnjn5e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2luoj", "parent_id": "t1_fnniuzp", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnnjn5e", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/g2luoj/over_43000_us_millionaires_will_get_stimulus/fnnjn5e/"}
