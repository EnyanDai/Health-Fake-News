Your own comment supports both of these ideas. When the crazies conspiracies have a floor of 5%, that both suggests that certain people are more predisposed to believe in conspiracies and that it is a small group of people.\n\nAside from that, I believe research does suggest that, depending on how your brain is wired, you, in fact, might be more likely to believe in conspiracies. The other things you said (marginalization, critical thinking skills) are true too, but it's also a matter of the people themselves.\n\nFinally, I thought your comment was meant to be 'scary', but I guess you didn't mean it that way. See, I do find the idea somewhat depressing that a potentially significant number of people believe in such things in light of such events as people destroying 5G towers and [men like this](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/us/pizzagate-attack-sentence.html).
