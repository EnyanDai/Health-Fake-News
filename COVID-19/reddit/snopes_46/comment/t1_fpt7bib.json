In March, Verizon said its service will soon reach 30 cities.\n\n\nhttps://www.stopfake.org/en/figure-of-the-week-5g/\n\n>\nIronically, as the New York Times reports, RT\u2019s fearmongering about 5G doesn\u2019t reflect the Kremlin\u2019s own position on the subject. On February 20th, President Putin ordered the launch of Russian 5G networks to great fanfare, announcing that \u201cthe challenge for the upcoming years is to organize universal access to high-speed internet, to start operation of the fifth-generation communication systems.\u201d\n\n>Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine public support for 5G technology in Western countries fit into the Kremlin\u2019s broader subversion strategy to weaken the West by any means possible, and thus to level the playing field in order to increase Russia\u2019s own competitive advantage.\n\n>Hampering the West\u2019s adoption of 5G networks, for example by hobbling democratic decision-making by inducing regulatory or legal battles about 5G\u2019s adverse health effects, would be a boon for the Kremlin\u2019s own pursuit of the technology.", "created_utc": 1588886129.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpt7bib", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpslno5", "score": 611, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 2, "edited": 1588891561.0, "name": "t1_fpt7bib", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpt7bib/"}
