It probably uses a waveguide (focus) to prevent the energy from dissipating over a long range. It only penetrates a few mm into the skin and heats it up causing pain.\n\nA home access point and a microwave use similar frequencies 2 to 5GHz. But a microwave oven outputs it at 1200Watts a home router less than 1W. It's the power or more accurately the energy that will harm you not the frequency. You can see light but if you were near a light of 50,000W it would harm you.\n\nThe inverse square law applies for every meter away from the source (antenna) the power drops by a factor of four. So two meters away from the source the power drops by another factor of four.  \n\nWater naturally emits 23.8GHz (5G is 24Gz) that's how weather satellites can see clouds and rain. Although 5G towers are much more powerful the inverse square law would tell you it's negligible by the time it gets to you a few meters away.\n\nA bullet from a gun weighs a few grams it won't hurt if I throw it at you. If I \"throw\" (shoot) it at you by putting the bullet in a cartridge with powder from a sealed chamber (gun) it will kill you.", "created_utc": 1586785139.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn9uwna", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g02rg2", "parent_id": "t1_fn8jhbl", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh11", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn9uwna", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/offbeat/comments/g02rg2/celebs_share_rumors_linking_5g_to_coronavirus/fn9uwna/"}
