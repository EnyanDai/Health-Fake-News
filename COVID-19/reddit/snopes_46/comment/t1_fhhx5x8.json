Of course since I don't care much for Android for various reasons I'm not that greatly updated. It's what they call brand-damage. Samsung damaged their brand years and years ago with me, and that's all I remember them by today. Android the same, my first experience was with a laggy device, and till this day i find Android devices extremely slow and laggy. Luckily Geekbench backs me up, the Samsung S20 has the same Single Core Score as a iPhone 6S from 2015!!! Jeej. Eitherway I think it's 2.5 years due to the EU forcing them to lol, not because they wanted. It is a positive development, but I get 5+ years for free now with Apple for a lower per device price. So it still doesn't interest me.  \n\n\nThere is simply to much wrong with Android to be a considered competition for me. As I developer why would I go back to 1999 Java language when I can do more in less time = $$ with Swift?", "created_utc": 1581613505.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fhhx5x8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_f38jqa", "parent_id": "t1_fhhw4nj", "score": -3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1f", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1581613775.0, "name": "t1_fhhx5x8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/f38jqa/digitimes_coronavirus_production_delays_will_not/fhhx5x8/"}
