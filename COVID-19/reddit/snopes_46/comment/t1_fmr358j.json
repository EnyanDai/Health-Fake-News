Probably not a big deal if you eat popcorn twice a week. \n\nBut if you play on your phone 9 hours a day......it might be a big deal. \n\nProblem is no one has done enough research to verify the short term effects and it will take decades for us to see the long term effects.", "created_utc": 1586312785.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmr358j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t1_fmqzhnc", "score": 25, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmr358j", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmr358j/"}
