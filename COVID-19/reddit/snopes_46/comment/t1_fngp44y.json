China put a shit load of resources and labour into developing their current system, plus blackmail and bribery to force large companies to assist. The UK government doesn't have even nearly as much pull over large businesses\n\nThen there's the biggest flaw in any wannabe fascist country, the UK doesn't have an enormous fully indoctrinated military force capable of such feats, our military is filled to the brim with normal folks, their oath isn't even to the government, it's to the queen and people, these aren't the kind of people you can convince large-scale to start threatening and killing their own people, Chinese soldiers will kill their friends and families or even children if told to, most UK soldiers aren't even comfortable shooting foreigners", "created_utc": 1586939752.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngp44y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g193vt", "parent_id": "t1_fngn5n7", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkli", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngp44y", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Scotland/comments/g193vt/south_ayrshire_phone_mast_set_on_fire_after/fngp44y/"}
