To keep my comment short, I'll just take one example: early on in the video, she says: *\"In humans, we have clear evidence of cancer now, no question\"* (wrt. 5G).\n\nLet's fact-check this.\n\n[The upper limit of the frequency of 5G radiation is 72 GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G) (in the superdata layer), which is well [beyond the visible spectrum's frequency range](https://www.cancer.gov/sites/g/files/xnrzdm211/files/styles/cgov_article/public/cgov_contextual_image/100/400/9/files/electromagnetic-spectrum-enlarge.png?itok=mEEBn-se), thus falls into the non-ionizing radiation type. **Currently, the only verifiable biological effect of non-ionizing (or RF) radiation is heating. No cancer.** ([Source](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet))\n\nBut okay, this is only a few sources. We need more to be sure. What do some fact-checking sites say?\n\nAccording to [Snopes.com](https://Snopes.com), the adverse health effects of wifi signals to humans and plants [remain unproven](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cress-wifi-experiment/). And here's [even more fact-check](https://fullfact.org/online/wuhan-5g-coronavirus/), because why not.\n\n*(The fact that she claims things like what I mentioned - which I could refute by googleing for 5 minutes for reputable sources - makes me question her competence... or integrity.)*\n\nI don't want to bore you with even more examples where she claims false things, because 1) you can find them easily, and 2) I'm pretty sure there is nothing out there that would convince you. It looks like you already decided for yourself that 5G is harmful, so no use arguing. Just wanted to show that this video is worth nothing as an argument.", "created_utc": 1587031303.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnkl7ci", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fd2qdd", "parent_id": "t1_fnjt6pl", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2emz4i", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnkl7ci", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/fd2qdd/the_5g_coronavirus_connection_explained/fnkl7ci/"}
