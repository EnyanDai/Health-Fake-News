Don't get me wrong, I'm arguing against your proposed one, not for the shitty first-past-the-post system we have now.\n\nYour system is fraught with complications and avenues for abuse. It relies on there being a correlation between educated and trustworthy, or educated and benevolant, and there is just no guarantee of that.\n\nI have a university degree. Hell, I have formal post-graduate qualifications. It's been ten years since I've done anything related to those fields, though. Would I have the expertise to make a more informed decision on that field than you, who is presumably in a different field? Barely. Does my post-graduate qualifications and decades in the field make me \"cream of the crop?\" No. That's largely lapsed knowledge that doesn't take into account the many and signifcant changes over the past ten years. So even some kind of certification system is nowhere near as simple as you imply.\n\nThe moment some people's votes are worth more than others, unscrupulous people will find a way to abuse the system and will proceed to do so in their favour. There's really no way to avoid that. Soon all important decisions will be getting made by a small group of people who will have massive vested interests to vote in their own favour. The country would fast become composed of those people whose votes matter, and the much larger population whose votes don't. That's never worked that well in the past for those whose votes don't matter.", "created_utc": 1587067227.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnm93ht", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnm80tq", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnm93ht", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnm93ht/"}
