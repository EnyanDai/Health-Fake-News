It has never and will never exist because it's an ideal that relies on an unattainable premise designed to lul people into a false sense of security while a thug government dismantles their freedoms. Its just sweet sounding words which, like religion, keeps the poor from murdering the rich.\n\n> Any form of capitalism will eventually become \"cronyism\" because thats the only way it can logically progress.\n\nTo counter this, every communist state in practice has literally become a totalitarian state. Examples: Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. In practice capitalism has lead to a higher quality of life and pretty much all of the innovation we enjoy today. \n\nIt's not capitalism that corrupts. It's communism. Private ownership isn't a matter of greed. It's about distributing the concentration of power so that IF a corrupt businessman or politician rises to power, they can't screw both sides over. That's WHY every communist state has descended into a totalitarian dictatorship.", "created_utc": 1586559652.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn1dbnm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fn13khq", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn1dbnm", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fn1dbnm/"}
