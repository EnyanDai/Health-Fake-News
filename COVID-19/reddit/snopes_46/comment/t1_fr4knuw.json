See, I always knew that floor as being about 23-25%, not 5%.\n\nHowever, for the sake of facts, where did you get that percentage from? I tried looking it up and I did get some interesting links, but I couldn't find any articles talking about the floor specifically.\n\nP.S. Some of the articles I found: [5% of Americans](https://www.space.com/moon-landing-hoax-conspiracy-may-grow.html) believe the moon landing is fake. [2% of Americans](https://www.insider.com/here-are-the-unproven-theories-americans-believe-in-the-most-2019-7) believe in flat earth (!!!!!).\n\nThat second one is especially alarming. That poll was conducted by INSIDER but the percentage was also corroborated in another [poll by YouGov](https://tecake.in/this-is-why-more-than-2-americans-believe-that-earth-is-flat). Even worse, the YouGov says 2% believes earth is flat but 5% have 'doubts'.\n\n5% doesn't sound a lot, but that's 16+Mn Americans.", "created_utc": 1589890869.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr4knuw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr3q4p7", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr4knuw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr4knuw/"}
