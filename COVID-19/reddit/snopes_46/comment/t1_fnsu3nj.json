This one is meant to make people look crazy. The actual, common, theory is that private companies will be pushing for 5G because it\u2019s the better technology to handle wide-spread surveillance, which is going to be needed to track the virus.\n\nTo fight this there is a believe that they\u2019ll need a way to scan our temperatures 24/7, and the 5G network is fast enough to handle that.  There is also ID2020 which pushes for a national ID system that involves injecting a dye into your skin- something that can be tracked with a faster network like 5G too. This was an idea before corona and now, unrelated, it looks like it has a real possibility of being implemented.\n\nThe media wants to you believe the anti-5G people are crazy idiots so they push these wild theories a handful of people believe. No, 5G did not cause corona. Will corona lead to wide-spread surveillance under the guise of safety using a risky transmission? In my opinion, absolutely.  And say what you want, the frequency of 5G is the first EMF at a millimeter and thousands of scientists oppose it.  \n\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/we-have-no-reason-to-believe-5g-is-safe/", "created_utc": 1587228819.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsu3nj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fns9iv0", "score": -8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnsu3nj", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnsu3nj/"}
