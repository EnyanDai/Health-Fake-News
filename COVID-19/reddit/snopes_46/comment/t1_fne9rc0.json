I use to look up to him and talk to him whenever I needed help, advice, or just a friend to spend time with. \n\nAbout a year ago I noticed he started really getting into conspiracies and started asking me to \"verify the information so you can learn the truth not just hear it from me\". Whenever I do try to verify and prove to him the story is false he gets upset even though he asked me to verify for myself. \n\nNow he's told me to stop verifying and just \"trust me, I was in the Navy and they taught us things they don't teach civilians\". I told him that was a straight cop-out. He's gotten so upset I won't believe him he has stopped talking to me.\n\nHe quit his job and now focuses on this crap full-time. He's like a completely different person. \n\nAll I can think is this is exactly what the people that create this bullshit want. One segment is using this bullshit to make money off these vulnerable minds and the other segment is spreading this information to get people to disconnect from reality.", "created_utc": 1586885536.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fne9rc0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g11x0r", "parent_id": "t3_g11x0r", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_5r98w", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fne9rc0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/FuckYouKaren/comments/g11x0r/when_somebody_says_5g_doesnt_cause_coronavirus/fne9rc0/"}
