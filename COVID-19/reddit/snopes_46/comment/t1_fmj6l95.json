So yep, I absolutely agree that n95's should all go to the front line in hospitals. However, the mind-numbing stupidity of forgetting about the utlity of simple cloth masks (scarves & bandanas even) in reducing transmission rates by some amount might well go down as one of the most tragic errors. If, on 1st March, the order had been \"mask up everyone\" (with home-made/cloth masks) then perhaps, maybe, just possibly, we'd be seeing low transmission rates like Taiwan, South Korea etc. Anyway, keep an eye on the Czech Republic - they have recently made mask wearing mandatory. Once they reopen their rise in cases - or lack of new cases - will be excellent evidence of the utility (or lack thereof) of cloth masks in reducing transmission.", "created_utc": 1586124070.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj6l95", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmj2v97", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj6l95", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmj6l95/"}
