I scanned through some of the individual studies and the largest group size was 12 rats. Also in one of these studies they place an antenna right next to the heart for 24h periods. In another study the conclusion was actually no effect on any organs besides the testes but aging with sample sizes so small there is no way to confirm that the biological differences they found werent already in place beforehand. Finally you just need basic knowledge of physics to know that the EMF's being studied do not possess the necessary energy to pull electrons from atoms. You literally have billions of low energy neutrinos blasting through your body every day. The Sun produces significantly more energetic radiation than any of these devices and one of the studies even acknowledges that would have a much greater effect on the cells they are studying. If you have ever had an X-ray or gone through the scanner at the airport you have had more energy pass through your body in those short moments than a wifi router will produce in a lifetime. I'll give it to you though 2G and 3G are recognized to be Class 2B carcinogens. You know what else are 2B carcinogens? Coffee, pickles, and aloe vera. You'll be more exposed to radiation outdoors than sitting next to a wifi router so you should probably stay inside and cover yourself with tinfoil if you are so concerned", "created_utc": 1586020696.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmf645s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuurfx", "parent_id": "t1_fmf0h96", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmf645s", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fuurfx/personal_thought_5g_is_coronavirus_is_controlled/fmf645s/"}
