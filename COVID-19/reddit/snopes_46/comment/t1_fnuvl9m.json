Mostly the same radiating frequencies and power levels, which is the only place the risk could come from. mmWave, sure, but those are also absurdly low power levels compared to the tv and radio stations that have been blasting hundreds of thousands to millions of watts non-stop for a very long time.\n\nThey're using different modulation methods and aggregation methods for 5g. none of which changes anything related to the dangerousness of the RF carriers the tower is sending out.\n\nIs there risk? Yeah, if you're on the tower. But viruses don't come from RF. It's non-ionizing radiation and can cause cancer through very high exposures consistently... Live right next to one? It's possible but not proven that the risk of cancer may be elevated, and even that's a huge stretch to be honest.\n\nBut this is one of the dumbest theories I've ever heard, and I'm actually into some conspiracies. But this one is just ridiculous and needs to die.\n\nDisclosure: I actually have a beef with 5g for technical reasons relating to repacking ATSC, but it's unrelated. 5g has nothing to do with covid.", "created_utc": 1587272262.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnuvl9m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "parent_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnuvl9m", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/g3n9zq/no_5g_does_not_spread_coronavirus/fnuvl9m/"}
