It was a legitimate cause. The masks that statement was referring to was the n95, not the DIY masks. \n\nYes the CDC was definitely mistaken in not implementing a \"mask up with cloth/DIY\" statement earlier. \n\n\nI'm just kind of tired of all the doctor bashing here. Doctors and other front line health care workers are in a severe shortage of PPE. They don't need to be mocked or villainized when they want to protect themselves. When healthcare workers are saying save masks for doctors, there is legitimate reason for that. \n\nIt seems we are both in agreement for most of viewpoints. I just don't think mocking \"save masks for  doctors\" is a right thing to do as it has validity. Mocking CDC for not telling people to make their own DIY masks or surgical/cloth masks is totally warranted.", "created_utc": 1586127887.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmjd482", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmj6l95", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmjd482", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmjd482/"}
