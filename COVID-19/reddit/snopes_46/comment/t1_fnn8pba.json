I worked for an NZ utility company.  All electricity meters needed to be recertified by a particular date. So it was decided that due to cost they would replace all meters where possible with a smart one.  The other issue is a lot of meters in NZ are over 40 or more years old and needed to be updated anyway.\n\nThe craked, stupid and the wackos started calling as soon as the announcement went out.  There was no rational or reasonable argument that could get through.\n\nPeople would ring on their mobiles to complain about electromagnetic radiation and I would tell them that during the call they received more radiation from their phone than a smart meter in 10 years.\n\nThe fact that electromagnetic radiation decreases significantly if there is a wall in the way didn't matter.\n\nNor did the fact that copper wiring in houses causes more electromagnetic radiation.\n\nBonkers considering smart meters give customers complete visibility of their power use.", "created_utc": 1587086859.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnn8pba", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t3_g2d5md", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587087126.0, "name": "t1_fnn8pba", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnn8pba/"}
