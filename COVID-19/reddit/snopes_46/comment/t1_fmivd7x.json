How does microwaving a rat demonstrate that a weak signal from a tower does harm? Anyone can cite sources, but if they are basically undecipherable unless you are an expert then how can you trust they provide evidence?\n\nMy thing is, the average home in the western world and other developed countries has had devices in it that use radio frequencies or product electromagnetic radiation in substantial doses since the 1980s, going on 40 years. In that time, if there was a meaningful public health risk present, then where are statistics showing it is a problem? If it was a large trend affecting the population as a whole it would be impossible to cover up and therefore someone would be able to prove a link to harm.
