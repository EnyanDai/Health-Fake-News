I'll be the first to say I don't understand 5G and all the health concerns, but why are big corporations allowed to put things around me that could be hazardous to my health, yet if I want to self medicate, I will be arrested and branded a \"junkie\" and \"criminal\"? I don't know for sure if 5G will affect mine or anyone else's health and without knowing for sure, why should I give consent to it? How many times have corporations come out with something and then later had lawsuits filed because whatever they created gave some one cancer or another health problem? Why do these corporations continue to get away with it? Yet I can't even take a medicine that makes my life better because it's \"illegal\". I don't want anyone blasting any sort of EMF or microwaves through me. It doesn't make any sense that anyone would have the power to even do so, yet I'm not even free to do with my body as I choose. \n\nI stick by original statement. The last thing anyone needs to be doing right now is rolling out 5G or worrying about faster internet. People should be real concerned about when the hell they'll be able to go outside, go to work and live life the way it use to be.. which we may never have happen. My internet was fine. I can download a song in 5 seconds, watch movies, etc.. do I really need it any faster? It's absurd & should be questioned & the timing is oddly strange. People can't even afford food or their bills right now, so who's worried about faster internet????\n\nMy mom mysteriously got a very aggressive and weird type of Leukemia that doesn't even run in our family. I've been wondering how and where it would have come from. The only thing I can think of is that ironically, she sits in the same room only roughly 5ft away from our Wi-Fi box everyday.", "created_utc": 1587040331.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnkukag", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1trvy", "parent_id": "t1_fnkn7ap", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587040591.0, "name": "t1_fnkukag", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/g1trvy/the_coronavirus_is_caused_by_5g_is_a/fnkukag/"}
