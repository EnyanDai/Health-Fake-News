You can keep posting *medical* studies from people who clearly don't have much physics background all you'd like, it doesn't change the fundamental behavior of non ionizing radiation which is extremely well understood. It's not fucking black magic lol, unless you don't understand it I suppose.\n\nPhysics and Biology go hand in hand. The wavelengths of these different frequencies make huge differences on the actual effects to biology. This is why medical studies ARE important. \n\n>You ignored my comment on higher energy infared waves above which competely destroys and physics based argument you might have had.\n\nInfrared happens to be good in some cases for people. I didn't see your comment on infrared regardless though, because it wasn't in response to me.", "created_utc": 1586971781.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fni08fx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnhxdg2", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586972078.0, "name": "t1_fni08fx", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fni08fx/"}
