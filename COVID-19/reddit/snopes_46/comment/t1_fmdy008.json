They're fascinating, but I don't know much about the nation or people. There's allot of connections between the Swiss specifically as well as a few other cultures and the mythologies and prophesies of the 1st People's in north America. There's many Hopi public speakers, for example, who have stated that the Swiss maintain the histories, traditions, and teachings of ancient European or really white cultures. Those cultures are not much different than any other ancient cultures, and they do seem quite unique. They're always neutral, very prepared, and always seem to be on the right side of things when it comes to human decency.
