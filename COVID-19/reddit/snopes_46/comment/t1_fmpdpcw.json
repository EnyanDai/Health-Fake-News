Ok sorry, we just got an increase of 0.00003ppm of neon in the atmosphere. We now must prove that it is still safe now that conditions have changed.\u201d This is evidently apparent when in vitro studies like the one you linked show a marginal change (that is cellular permeability) that is irrelevant to us as humans. \n\nYou can\u2019t prove a negative as the adage goes. Your position seems dependent on a great number of stakeholders in the largest industries on earth all unknowingly plunging us into ruin. Just like Professor Havas, your position is hinged on \"we just haven't done enough research yet\" which is a grossly inaccurate misrepresentation of our current knowledge of physics and biology. If there is a risk, it will be a liability for a company. Citizen science is at an all time high. If there are negative effects, the truth will come out, and the companies who installed it will be liable.\n\nIf nothing else, trust the inherently litigious American soul to ensure things are all ok.\n\nOr, learn more about how this works and understand that nearly none of the studies referenced included even an analog of human skin. Skin is the reason Alpha radiation doesn\u2019t cause nasty genetic mayhem. If we inhale a dust that is alpha radioactive, the effects are nasty, but it won\u2019t pass through our skin. Nevertheless, I can point you at hundreds of papers on how Alpha radiation triggers genetic mutation. In a Petrie dish. (Or when inhaled, but we don\u2019t inhale 5G masts) The papers are telling the truth, but count on the reader to be able to understand the conditions of the experiment and not irresponsibly draw conclusions that ignore reality.", "created_utc": 1586278996.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmpdpcw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmp99vr", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmpdpcw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmpdpcw/"}
