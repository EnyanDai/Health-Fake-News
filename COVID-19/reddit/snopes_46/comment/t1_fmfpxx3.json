The basis of which likely comes through Bill Gates' ID 2020 program, since he spoke in his recent IAMA about \"digital certificates\" to prove who's vaccinated and who's not.\n\nThe idea of eventually all purchases coming through implanted chips similar to those already in our phones, as well as identification information, does make sense for practicality and convenience and efficiency, although there are severe ethical and religious objections to these things A) mandatory vaccines, B) implanted computer chips in our bodies.\n\nA lot of fear comes from the Revelations bible verse that states that eventually people will not be able to buy and sell without a \"mark\" on the right hand or forehead, which would make sense with the idea of an implantable chip with all our information on it, that the government could in fact possibly \"shut down\" and take your chip off the network if you do not play ball with them.\n\nA lot of this seems to me avoidable since this technology wasn't around during Bible times... and also that if you get the chip in your left hand that seems to avoid aligning with the prophecy... although again, chipping humans like we do our pets seems to be an ethical issue as it is.\n\nGovernments and vaccines or not, 5G seems to be very controversial and like many things these days there seems to be positive and negative evidence for and against the implementation of 5G.
