The history of medicine is riddled with people intentionally (and unintentionally) harming others. [Consider one of the latest vaccine scandals in China that has fomented distrust in the population](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18\\)31695-7/fulltext), which has nothing to do with Jenny McCarthy and a league of infuensters killing kids as a result of a faked academic article from twenty years ago. [Consider the CIA obtaining access to Osama bin Laden's familial DNA through a faked vaccination drive.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/02/150227-polio-pakistan-vaccination-taliban-osama-bin-laden/) We probably have to engage with anti-vaxxers in a more substantive way than simply telling people to trust experts, carte blanche. Plenty of people have good reasons not to believe in their institutions.\n\nEdit: The person you were talking with was also not necessarily wrong. [For example, in 2009 a swine flu vaccine led to narcolepsy for a then-unknown reason, and GSK, the pharmaceutical company that developed it, ended up coughing up compensation money to some of the affected](http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2015/07/side-effect-of-flu-vaccine-yields-new-insights-into-narcolepsy.html). There are many many vaccines, and it's a mistake to talk about them as a monolith. That person is incorrect if they presented their argument as if all vaccines were proven to cause illness, of course.", "created_utc": 1586919698.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fng0u85", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1gtim", "parent_id": "t1_fnfzmq7", "score": 18, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586920585.0, "name": "t1_fng0u85", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/australia/comments/g1gtim/5g_and_antivax_conspiracy_theorists_are/fng0u85/"}
