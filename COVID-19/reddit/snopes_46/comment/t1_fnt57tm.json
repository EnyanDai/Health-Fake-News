But in Western democracies, before the advent of social media, the only way to discriminate news across large areas was the newspapers and the major tv networks.\n\nSure, they peddled in propaganda sometimes, but ultimately their reporting tended to be based on truth.  Plus, since people only had access to maybe 5-6 news sources, everyone generally believed the same things (generally...not completely).\n\nSo it hasn't always been the way it is now.  You wouldn't have seen this 5g conspiracy bullshit in 1985, 1995, or 2005.  Social media and unfactual conspiracy websites have done this, and the bad actors they abuse them.
