I'm all for free speech, as long as it doesn't directly harm someone like yelling fire in a crowd, or telling people to drink chemicals.\n\nRacism is a really good example. People are free to be racists, and speak accordingly. Not only are the rest of us free to call them a dumbass, it lets these people identify them selves to the public so we can avoid them and their businesses.\n\nBut you censor them and it gives them more power. People have this mentality if someones trying to push it down, then there must be truth to it.\n\nIt's just people are willing to believe something they heard with no evidence if it fits their narrative in some fashion. Usually these people are angry and looking for someone to blame. This mindset is scary because it's what lead to a Nazi controlled Germany.\n\nCensorship will just stoke the anger that's already there.", "created_utc": 1586113878.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmiotli", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmij0h9", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmiotli", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmiotli/"}
