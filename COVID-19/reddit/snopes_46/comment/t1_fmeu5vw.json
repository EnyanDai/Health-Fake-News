I apologise for any misunderstanding by proposing that things could, in fact, be connected.\n\n> No, you presented it as a gotcha. Here's what you said for reference:\n\nI actually do not need you to repeat what I wrote. I know what I wrote. Bizzarely, you repeating what I wrote is essentially telling me that I did not know what I wrote but that you do. Which pointedly demonstrates that you have entirely missed the point because you do not, in fact, understand what I wrote.\n\nWhich is fine. We can all move on and laugh about it in the morning. Except Rachel Riley who is engaged in litigation. Which is no laughing matter.\n\n> I'm deliberately not commenting on Riley's libel lawsuit\n\nStrangely enough: me too. I am drawing your attention to it. But not with any comment because I have zero opinion about the particular lawsuit. It was merely an example that someone can be both accuse of, and be accused of, libel. All they have to do is be absolutely sure that this or that is an obvious edit.\n\nI suspect you will still not get the point.
