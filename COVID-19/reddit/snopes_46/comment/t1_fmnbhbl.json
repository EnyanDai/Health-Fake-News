My mom still believes insane shit even though I provide her with the  right information routinely. I guess I wish she was never exposed to  that in the first place. \n\nI can sympathize with that. The hard truth is you can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into. Your mom believes insane shit because for whatever reason she *wants* to believe insane shit. Again, you could try to censor it, but usually, that will just make the censored person in question that much more convinced that they've found \"the truth\" that no one wants them to find. I don't know if you could censor enough to completely eliminate that exposure, and if you did, I don't think that's a free society anymore or any place that I'd want to live in.\n\nBecause who decides what's censored and what's not? Who is infallible enough that we should be comfortable saying \"They know what's best for us.\"?", "created_utc": 1586222315.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmnbhbl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmmpw17", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmnbhbl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmnbhbl/"}
