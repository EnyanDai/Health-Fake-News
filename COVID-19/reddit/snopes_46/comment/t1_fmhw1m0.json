You said:\n>20k satellite are up in space for 5G now\n\n\n>the globe is blanketed in it [5G] now\n\nThese are both patently false. You do know the difference between having plans to do something, and that thing actually being complete, right? Starlink has had a *handful* of launches, and they do plan on having thousands of satellites *someday* (which will take many years of regular, high-tempo launches, the likes of which has never been done), but it's just a fact there are not 20k satellites right now. And here's the kicker: satellites aren't 5G. None of them. That's not a thing. Starlink (and others being considered) need *ground stations* that communicate to the satellites (again, not via 5G). The sats themselves have no 5G hardware on them. The ground stations *might* be 5G to serve their local area, but they could also be wifi or 4G or even ethernet. Musk (Starlink) actually recently said [5G probably doesn't make sense for Starlink distribution] (http://interactive.satellitetoday.com/via/satellite-2020-show-daily-day-2/ahead-of-his-time-musk-brings-the-rhyme-to-satellite/) because they are targeting more rural customers, which means they'd go for something with better range, like 3G or 4G.\n\nSo even if/when there are thousands of satellites, that doesn't mean they are blanketing the earth in 5G. It completely depends on the ground stations and the market, but **no 5G is being beamed down on you from space**, ever, that is just plain wrong. 5G is in like 30-ish US cities right now (and the majority of that is the version that is more similar to LTE, not the ultra wideband one yet), there is just no global blanket. Yes, the cell companies are actively deploying 5G, but satellites have nothing to do with it yet, and likely won't for several years (and possibly even ever).", "created_utc": 1586095418.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmhw1m0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t1_fmhb029", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmhw1m0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmhw1m0/"}
