A bunch of them told me that what convinced them personally is that they started hearing their neighbors/government/aliens plotting brainwashing campaign against them. As in they heard this while being at home. This is obviously explained by 5g and not a schizophernia. And many keep hearing various voices that are usually laughing or verbally abusing them.\n\nI would really like to nudge these people to get mental health, but have no idea how to do it without being instantly categorized as the man coming after them.", "created_utc": 1586008721.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmen096", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_furdeu", "parent_id": "t1_fmekm7j", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmen096", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/furdeu/masts_set_on_fire_over_false_5g_coronavirus_claims/fmen096/"}
