Pretty much nothing but continue with business as usual stating it was China's problem, with many proclaiming, 'they deserved it.'  Even US politicians took pleasure in China's misfortune by claiming it would bring jobs lost to China back to the US.\n\nAnd what did the UK do when faced with the outbreak?  It told its citizens to continue life as normal and intentionally get infected to develop an immunity to the virus.  This is akin to proclaiming that bathing caused sickness, which was widely believed by Anglos during the Middle Ages up until the late 19th century.\n\nThe purported 'public relations disaster for China' has largely been orchestrated by the west and started with 'Yellow Peril' racism during the colonial era, which evidently, continues to this day as China is viewed as biggest threat to US led Anglo hegemony, which is just a euphemism for White supremacy.\n\n[Yellow Peril - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Peril)", "created_utc": 1585662819.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm0odcn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fs11kb", "parent_id": "t3_fs11kb", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585663036.0, "name": "t1_fm0odcn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China/comments/fs11kb/the_coronavirus_is_becoming_a_public_relations/fm0odcn/"}
