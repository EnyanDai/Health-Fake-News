That's 2400 bits per second. Then we got 4800 and some of us 9600. Then AOL came out with a sales campaign mailing people diskettes. I tried it out, the diskette installed AOL on my machine and gave me a free month. It would start up, show the opening screen, then crank, crank, crank, occasionally showing a banner \"Adding Art\". Crank, crank, crank, about once an hour it would actually display something. So I decided to cancel. But where's the cancel menu choice? Hunt around in the menus, many circular paths; it would actually rearrange the menus when you got too close to the cancel function. I finally cornered it; just a phone number. Dialing that, got put on hold with the cruddiest music you ever heard on a 10 second loop. I finally gave up, called back from work where I had a speaker phone. After 5 hours, I exaggerate not, 5 HOURS somebody picked up and took my cancel. They charged me for an extra month. I surmise there were lotsa folks (20 million subscribers) who just kept paying $19.95 a month because they couldn't figure out how to cancel. This generated an enormous pile of money which the AOL folks didn't know what to do with. It's still circulating around the economy as AOLTimeWarnerDisneyMSNBCEtc, like a hairball that won't digest and won't come up to light.", "created_utc": 1587253305.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnu2jr9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntsn2m", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnu2jr9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnu2jr9/"}
