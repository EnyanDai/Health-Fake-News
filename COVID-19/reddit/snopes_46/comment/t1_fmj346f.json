If there are shortages of masks and equipment for healthcare workers and the only way to fix that is to ramp up production and also tell non essential workers to cover up with a scarf or homemade mask instead of an n95, ffp3 whatever that could be used for a frontline worker.\n\nI am a frontline worker now. 33% of the patients in our care are now suspected cases. That number will rise and soon the staff will all be suspected too but they are not testing us. We had a death two days ago due to coronavirus. One patient went to hospital because of low saturation 10 days ago and was tested negative once, then when they came back to us 6 days later they were not given a second test. We've been told they won't retest him and he is gasping for air, and another of our patients whose chest is sounding heavy and is having headaches we've been told his symptoms aren't serious enough to send to hospital for testing. They're saying this because Public Health England aren't supplying enough tests nation-wide.", "created_utc": 1586122063.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj346f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmimqti", "score": 18, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj346f", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmj346f/"}
