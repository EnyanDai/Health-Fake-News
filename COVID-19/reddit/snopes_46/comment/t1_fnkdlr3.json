I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.", "created_utc": 1587023134.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnkdlr3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1rjw4", "parent_id": "t1_fnil7ig", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3eg3f", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnkdlr3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskOuija/comments/g1rjw4/to_all_people_who_believe_5g_is_the_spread_of/fnkdlr3/"}
