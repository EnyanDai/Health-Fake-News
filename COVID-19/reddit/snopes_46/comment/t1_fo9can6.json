It's when you say that essential oils should replace MEDICINE that it becomes anti-science. But simply liking them isn't really that big of a deal, and tons of people find them soothing and therapeutic. Scents can really help your mood. \n\nAnd that's clearly not all they said. They all but called her a \"nut job\" and implied that she's anti-science like Tati. So yeah, forgive me for taking an issue with that. Accusing someone of being anti-science isn't something you do lightly, and it can be pretty damaging to their rep \u2013 especially in times like these. Someone being into astrology isn't just license to imply terrible things about them \u2013 *especially* when the truth is, they've been sitting their butt at home and telling their followers to stay home/wash their hands/follow proper coronavirus guidelines.", "created_utc": 1587615685.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo9can6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g6afbr", "parent_id": "t1_fo9c160", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3jayp", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo9can6", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/g6afbr/tati_posts_about_5g_during_a_time_of/fo9can6/"}
