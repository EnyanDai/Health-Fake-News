Calling things conspiracies or fake news is a viable tactic especially in modern times to discredit information, which is fucked up and has been abused more in the most recent presidency than ever before. However, modern mainstream ideas of conspiracy theories like a fake moon landing or a flat earth  or 9/11 or this cell phone idea is often due to a distrust of government. Reality can be incredibly boring and one that has you as a person \u201cin the know\u201d where you can see what others can\u2019t gives a sense of superiority and confirmation bias fuels the fire. I wrote an entire thesis on the conspiracies involved in Area 51, Project Blue Book and Roswell as well as the psychology behind them. The truth is conspiracies give people community, a place of shared interest through forums and gatherings, they give a reason to see themself as the underdog fighting for a greater cause, a way to know the truth while others are seemingly blinded by lies like science etc.Conspiratorial thinking is noting new, conspiracy theories like Nero starting the fire in Rome have been around as long as people have, it keeps rulers alive and gives people doubt, that being said those same ideas can lead to truly baseless claims like in this case 5g causes illness, which anyone who studies either physics or disease will tell you is incorrect.", "created_utc": 1586140860.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmjzbka", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmhuh66", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmjzbka", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmjzbka/"}
