You should be able to find a federal statute fairly easily if \"publisher vs platform\" is really a legal distinction.\n\nI only ask this because what you stated is someone's interpretation of what a law *should* mean that has been passed around a lot as fact much like the entrapment example from above.", "created_utc": 1586198987.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmm560f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fw0hr2", "parent_id": "t1_fmlwbve", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmm560f", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fw0hr2/youtube_is_censoring_all_videos_related_to/fmm560f/"}
