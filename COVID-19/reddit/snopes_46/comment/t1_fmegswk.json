He's very good at methodically and logically working his way through difficult and complex application database problems and coming to a nicely optimized solution. \n\nBut then there's this other side to him where he goes to \"gong showers\" (look it up: It's total bloody nonsense) where the gongs are \"tuned to the frequencies of planets\". He thinks the ideas in his mind \"come from above\" (and he does this hands raised to the sky gesture when he talks about it), thinks cancer is caused by our thoughts (but not in the psychosomatic way, more like the medieval \"have bad thoughts, get bad consequences\" kind of way) and other stuff that's just so insane that when he first mentioned it to me I flat out laughed in his face. I just try and avoid taking about anything that's not work with him because he's a nice guy and I don't want to upset him but this kind of thing makes me so angry I find it genuinely difficult to not tell him to shut his stupid mouth and keep his idiot opinions to himself.", "created_utc": 1586003422.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmegswk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_furdeu", "parent_id": "t1_fmedr3x", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586004547.0, "name": "t1_fmegswk", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/furdeu/masts_set_on_fire_over_false_5g_coronavirus_claims/fmegswk/"}
