We're talking maybe a 100 meter range, tops, pr transmitter. or a 100 meter range in all directions if they used four transmitters on a \"tower\". Piercing power is close to none. If these get deployed in residential areas, they won't even reach through your window.\n\nOn high-band, we're talking about frequencies ranging from 24ghz to approx 72ghz. Again. The real broadcasting frequency will depend on what the country's FCC gives permission for.\n\n4g operates at between 410mhz to 5.9ghz, depending on the country, and which frequencies the FCC in the respected country allot them to use. In most countries, it's usually been one of each, with the lower one at \\~700-900mhz and the higher one at 1400-1900mhz.", "created_utc": 1586710317.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn6zeah", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t1_fmr358j", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn6zeah", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fn6zeah/"}
