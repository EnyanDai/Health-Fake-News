Now with 5g they ignore this and just push it further so anyone lives near radiation. They put towers on houses and schools with no permission. People should have the choice and the way its been rolled out is not right at all.\nAnother concern is the fact that Huawei is trying to push 5g in a monopolistic fashion and I speculate the whole link with Corona has something to do with this.\nThe Corona link however is not about 5g causing it, its mainly about the crisis being used to roll out 5g even tough voters in a lot of areas are against it.\n\nThis last part is pretty important if you believe in democracy..\nNot into conspiracy myself, it hurts us all and makes the actual concerned scientists look like dumb asses, but the government is acting very shady right now and they are pushing stuff against the Will of many many people/professionals/states/..\nAs for stating 5g has no health hazards you should explain this without ignoring that mobile phone and WiFi use does have proven health hazards... If you leave this out people on that \u2018side\u2019 Will not take you seriously.", "created_utc": 1586643517.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn4kysf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyudtd", "parent_id": "t1_fn2151p", "score": -4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn4kysf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/fyudtd/coronavirus_conspiracies_like_that_bogus_5g_claim/fn4kysf/"}
