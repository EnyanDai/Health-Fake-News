He makes so many juvenile mistakes that it's ridiculous.  It's no wonder that his medical license was revoked in NY.  The human body cannot produce influenza viruses.  Not how they work at all.  The Spanish flu was a swine flu strain with some avian flu elements.  And he also says that Spanish Flu was spread by the vaccine even though the first influenza vaccine wouldn't be produced for 20 years.  The influenza virus itself wasn't even isolated until 1933.  \n\n>He backs his claim by saying that there was never proof of the Spanish Flu virus being transmitted directly from person to person. Apparantly, they even tried to make it happen physically with no results.\n\nThat's just ridiculous.  It was only spread through human to human transmission.  Healthcare workers treating the infected were hit especially hard.  Areas that isolated themselves had much lower cases, if any cases at all as there were several towns that completely cut themselves off from the rest of society and did not have any cases despite the towns right next to them having cases.  If this were caused by radio towers, even towns that isolated would have had tons of cases.  \n\nCommon sense is your rebuttal.", "created_utc": 1587237855.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fntamns", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "parent_id": "t1_fnsxbb5", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fntamns", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/g3n9zq/no_5g_does_not_spread_coronavirus/fntamns/"}
