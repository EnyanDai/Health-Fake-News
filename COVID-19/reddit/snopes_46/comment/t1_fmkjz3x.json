That isn't the issue. I'm not arguing that I think clear misinformation should be banned from YouTube. I'm arguing that they're not doing anything wrong by removing that content.\n\nAgain, it's completely irrelevant how big the difference is, since both things would have been fine under your previous statement.\n\nAnd of course I would try to argue with my mother, but you're missing the point yet again. It has become very clear at this point that simple evidence and facts aren't enough to disprove conspiracy theorists, so it's not an effective tactic. Much like arguing with a person you know who's deep into flat earth, lizard people and other more dangerous conspiracy theories will prove futile when basic physics is rejected. At that point I won't put tape over their mouths, I will simply not talk to them anymore.\n\nAnd YouTube aren't putting tape over anyone's mouth. It's not a basic human right to be on YouTube, and they're not taking away your freedom to express yourself. If you wanna go outside and shout your ideas at people, that's fine. But it's not infringing on your freedom if I don't let you borrow my megaphone.", "created_utc": 1586157566.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkjz3x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmkjfqx", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkjz3x", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmkjz3x/"}
