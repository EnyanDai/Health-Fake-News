We always had a social immune system.  Isolating crazy Earl and crazy Joe. Now they can get together and even recruit!  And we have not developed the antibodies to stop this yet.\n\nIt used to be that you had to have some semblance of success to be heard by your community.  Noone listens to crazy Joe.  He couldn't run an ice cream stand, he's going to tell us when to sow the field and what to put on it and when?  No.  Now that could be bad but usually it was not.  Because the real world demands results, otherwise we, ya know, die.  So almost always the people who people listened to actually did some real shit.  Of course there were scammers and we remember them because it's an interesting story.  But 99% of the time shit went normally because we listened to smart people and that was that.  And that's not fun to re-tell.  \n\nBut that system has been circumvented.  The internet allows the spread of information.  True and false.  All the same.  It's up to each person to determine what they think is true.  Imagine if we allowed school curriculum to be determined by each student personally.  How much actual information would get disseminated?  Actual facts?\n\nBasically what u/jugalator is saying", "created_utc": 1586957532.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnh8s4g", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngetbv", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586957788.0, "name": "t1_fnh8s4g", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnh8s4g/"}
