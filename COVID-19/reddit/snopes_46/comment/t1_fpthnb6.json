At least here if you have a sudden interest to pursue engineering physics or electrical engineering to build lasers n shit, university is free and the government will partly pay and offer 0% loans to pay for accommodation and other expenses at any point in your life. \n\nBut then people show up day 1 of class and find out \"Oh shit, I have to learn calculus for this\" and drop out. \n\nHumanity has been around long enough that all the easy stuff has been figured out many times over, there's really nothing meaningful anyone can contribute just based on a sudden interest.\n\nHowever what you can do on a sudden interest is to do some googling and come up with a theory that the Earth is flat or that 5G is bad. That will make you feel like you're contributing something to the overall knowledge, or that you've figured out something nobody else has thought of.", "created_utc": 1588891421.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpthnb6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt8yds", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpthnb6", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpthnb6/"}
