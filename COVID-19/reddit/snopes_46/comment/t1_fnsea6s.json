It's basic comprehension to then know a reply is also about that power station. My comment even said 'THE power station'.\n\nDo not hold me to a different standard to yourself. Get off your high horse. You've posted nothing to prove there is no risk.\n\nI've already posted a link showing GCHQ had concerns.
