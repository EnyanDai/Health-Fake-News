Luckily several European countries have this data published and updated weekly here - [https://www.euromomo.eu/index.html](https://www.euromomo.eu/index.html)\n\nRegardless of how the numbers are shuffled around, excess mortality will be an unbiased measure of the severity of the epidemic. As you can see from the graphs, there is currently only excess mortality in Italy, Spain, and to a lesser extent England and Switzerland. Notice that Sweden who didn't do any lockdowns, has 0 excess mortality. Same with the Netherlands which was very lax in their restrictions. Most countries are at normal levels. If there was truly a dangerous disease spreading, we would be seeing it in the excess mortality. Note that Northern Italy has the highest air pollution in Europe, and has been seeing issues with lung disease for the past several years. Their hospital system has been overburdened. I suspect the fear produced by the media and the government lockdowns contributed quite a bit to the situation there.", "created_utc": 1586435773.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmvzfxv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fxr6sc", "parent_id": "t3_fxr6sc", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmvzfxv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fxr6sc/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmvzfxv/"}
