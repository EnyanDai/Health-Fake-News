Throw a frozen ham in the microwave and notice how it will only cook the outside. \n\n2ed, so much wrong here, you can't reverse the spin of a election with radiation. You can with a ***very*** strong electro magnetic field, but considering your phone is working right now, you can see that it's not happening to you, nor has it ever.\n\nAnd 3rd, like this seriously some shit you should have googled. Low energy EM fields arnt going to  crack O2 to make Atomic Oxygen. You need UV radiation of a high out put that it would give you a sun burn in about 2 seconds. See your skin, it's not sunburnt, your fine.
