Like I said, it's our current scientific understanding that these towers have no negative health effects. It's not up to them to provide anyone research. When TV manufacturers invented 4K TV's, they didn't have to *prove* to anyone that they don't cause negative health effects because the technology was built on previous technology and our current understanding of that technology did not indicate any adverse health effects.  \n\nProving no effect is impossible, and any such proof would be immediately invalidated the moment the most minute thing was added to the equation. \u201cWell, we know cell phones 100% do NOT kill us. Ok sorry, we just got an increase of 0.00003ppm of neon in the atmosphere. We now must prove that it is still safe now that conditions have changed.\u201d  \n\nSo even if these 5G companies were to put forward thousands of papers showing no adverse health effects, the minute someone produces a paper showing minute differences in cell membrane permeability, all of their work would be invalidated. That's why I say it's impossible to prove a negative so these \"studies\" showing no effect are completely moot to present to critics.", "created_utc": 1586964309.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnhkxxu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnhieso", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnhkxxu", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnhkxxu/"}
