The same can be said for other issues - interracial marriage, gay marriage, drug legalization... all were issues that large segments of society at one point thought posed a significant risk. Today, not so much.\n\nCensoring information because it doesn't conform to contemporary views is short sighted, because views change. Even crazy conspiracy theories about 5g or anti-vax deserve to be heard, and then disproven and ridiculed if necessary. Freedom of speech isn't solely about the right of the speaker to be heard, but also the right of those who wish to hear what they have to say.\n\nFurthermore, I'm fairly confident in saying COVID-19 is not spread via 5g, however, what if it was? Sure, it sounds crazy, but the idea of a multi-ton metal tube transporting hundreds of people around the world in the air, or shooting people in a rocket to the moon, or fuck, even wirelessly sending information around the world near instantly (5g) sounded crazy at one point.
