You have no conceptual idea of how any of this works do you? There is such a thing as end to end encryption you know and you are allowed to do that on commercial bands. That stuff sits way above the RF layer of the communication channel (go read on the OSI model). Everything you currently do wirelessly either uses encryption or doesn't. In fact for us ofcom registered radio operators we transmit plain communications only with our call signs attached and have done for the last 100 years. That's fine but ISM / commercial bands, do what you like over them.\n\nThis is why I despise mentalities like yours. You think you're smart but you're not. Simply touting \"end-to-end\" encryption is meaningless. Why are you mentioning it? Do you think the average public has a good grasp of which services are end-to-end encrypted and which are not? Do you think joe public even knows the difference between AES, DES or RSA? You think you're clever trying to explain to me encryption methods as if they have any fucking thing to do with what I am talking about. Hyper precise location data, the fact that China seems to be largely the sole affordable and efficient provider of 5G (and a lot of 4G tbh) infrastructure, manufacturers having access to a wealth of usage information and the potential to control remote connected appliances...you think there is not a potential avenue for abuse? Has the last ten years taught you fucking nothing???\n\nJesus.", "created_utc": 1585915857.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmb1rsf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fu4x2o", "parent_id": "t1_fmayvh8", "score": -15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmb1rsf", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fu4x2o/uk_media_outlets_told_not_to_promote_baseless_5g/fmb1rsf/"}
