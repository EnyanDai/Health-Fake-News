However it has existed for ages, and there\u2019s a term for it. Cognitive dissonance. It\u2019s surprisingly common for someone to have two completely contradictory ideas at once, I\u2019d even argue that it\u2019s something uniquely human. \n\nThat being said, we\u2019re in a time of crisis and when people are desperate they search for answers. On top of that, I\u2019ve seen some of these pseudoscientific videos explaining this \u201c5G phenomenon\u201d and many of them are very well made. They carefully explain step 1 to step 2 to step 3 and so on, about how this process occurs.\n\nThe problem is, is that they\u2019re making huge assumptions and bold claims that don\u2019t exist along the way. When people state lies like a fact (ie. Trump when he tells his lies about how well the economy is doing and how close we are to being done with coronavirus) people are more inclined to believe them.\n\nI blame people in positions of power who tout pseudoscientific trash. I blame the lack of science literacy. I blame people who are anti-knowledge. I don\u2019t think your father is a medical anomaly, I think he\u2019s not scientifically literate. It\u2019s hard to piece together the science when you have little to no understanding of science. Especially when it\u2019s as nuanced as radiation/virology. You can\u2019t learn about those topics in a 15 minute YouTube video.", "created_utc": 1587501872.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo4cao3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "parent_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587502839.0, "name": "t1_fo4cao3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskDocs/comments/g5fyvm/my_very_smart_dad_has_recently_started_reading/fo4cao3/"}
