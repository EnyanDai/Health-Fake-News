If it could, a strong enough signal would prevent rust, which is a fairly similar chemical process to oxygen/hemaglobin binding. \n\n>And in the case of oxygen being a diatomic particle, oscillating would equate to spinning. \n\nNo it wouldn't. Where did you get this idea? It would equate to vibrating, which is a completely different phenomenon. Vibrating at a high frequency or energy is referred to as heat at large scales. Rotation is not oscillation.\n\n>This was not designed to be a scholarly article.\n\nThis is obvious. You have no idea what you're talking about.
