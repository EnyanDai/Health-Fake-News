It sounds like you weren't so taken in by religion as a kid. Do you remember there being a moment when you stopped believing or started seriously questioning, or perhaps you never rememer truely believing in the first place?\n\nThe moralising attitude is what I struggle with as well (other than the pure simple frustration that comes from knowing millions of people out there believe in such spurious, illogical, dangerous, ancient nonsense and spread it to others). The idea that I am incapable of behaving decently, the idea that I could just go off the rails and commit heinous acts because I don't believe in and don't fear some arbitary backwards concept, rather than because I have a basic sense of empathy and a natural willingness to cooperate with and help people and live a good life simply because it makes sense, is quite the insult. At least it would be if it wasn't so laughably nonsensical.\n\nI'm sure you're aware of Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Matt Dillahunty etc. They usually give me a sense of relief, ammunition if I have to talk to a religious person, and plenty of laughs. \n\nI saw something by Sam Harris recently that I thought was an excellent breakdown of everything that's wrong with religion - [Sam Harris Destroys Craig in debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM-BC5QHexU).\n\nThis one though was a brilliant conversation between Sam and I think a vicar/clergyman, if only everyone could speak about their differences so maturely - [A Conversation of Faith with Sam Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arutkG207vI)", "created_utc": 1586639514.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn4e4pl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmknyap", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn4e4pl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fn4e4pl/"}
