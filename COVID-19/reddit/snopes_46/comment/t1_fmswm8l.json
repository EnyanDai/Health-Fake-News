It only links to an study which exposed rats to power exposure dozens of times higher than the average maximum allowed, for 9 hours a day (3.5 and 6 W/kg, vs. 0.08 W/kg limit). \n\nI found particularly funny when they cited the WHO, \"...concluded that EMFs of frequencies 30 KHz \u2013 300 GHz are possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B),\" they literally cited almost the entirety electromagnetic spectrum. It's like saying \"Swimming in pools with a temperature ranging from 0 - 100 C can prove to be fatal if done for prolonged periods of time.\" \n\nThe RFSafe article is a total joke, I'm sure 2nd year students taking the basic electromagnetic chapter in Physics II can do much better. The vast majority of 5G systems work on the ranges of 2.4-5GHz which is the pretty much the modern day standard for anything wireless. Plus just because something works in the same spectrum doesn't mean it does the same thing. You can do a crapton of unrelated things inside a spectrum.\n\nHere, this guy probably read your comment and decided to do an IamA.
