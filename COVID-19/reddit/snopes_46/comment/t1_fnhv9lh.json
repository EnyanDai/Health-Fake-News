They have been done - during the better part of 40 years of EMR research. It's our current scientific understanding that these towers have no negative health effects, including that on human skin cells.  \n>  \n>Besides, that's not how the burden of proof works. It's not up to someone to prove a negative - that's impossible. You can't prove that something doesn't exist. It's up to skeptics to do the research and prove something does exist, ie. higher cancer rates at 5G towers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you... are telling me... that you have 40 years of research on your side about 5G and these bands being safe? But then you say, that the burden of proof is on my side?\n\nYou haven't posted a single study of these bands \"being safe\", let alone at the energy that beamforming produces, yet you say there are many.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It's up to skeptics to do the research and prove something does exist, ie. higher cancer rates at 5G towers.\n\nA study by  [**Wolf and Wolf (2004)**](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.527.1036&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\u00a0showed a significant increase in cancer in those living within 350 feet of a cell tower.\u00a0[**Eger (2004)** ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241473738_The_Influence_of_Being_Physically_Near_to_a_Cell_Phone_Transmission_Mast_on_the_Incidence_of_Cancer)found an increase in new cancer cases within a 10-year period if residents lived within 400 meters of a cell tower. They also found that within 5 years of operation of the transmitting base station the relative risk of cancer development tripled in residents near the cell tower compared to resident living outside the area. [**Dode (2011)**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969711005754) performed a 10-year study (1996-2006) examining the distance from cell towers and cancer clusters. He and his colleagues found a significant increase in cancers in those living within 500 meters of the cell tower. They noted, \u201cThe largest density power was 40.78 \u03bcW/cm2, and the smallest was 0.04 \u03bcW/cm2.\u201d\u00a0 I should note again from my first post, that 5G produces 1400-2000 \u03bcW/cm2 anywhere in it's line of site even 100ft away. So while these old studies are about other cell tower types, the question still stands. Why the fuck are they rolling these out in my neighborhood without studies?\n\nAnd of course, heres a sprint 5g omni antenna tower being taken down after the 4th kid at the school it was placed at developed cancer.\n\n[https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2019/03/25/ripon-cell-tower-school-removal-cancer/](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2019/03/25/ripon-cell-tower-school-removal-cancer/)", "created_utc": 1586969434.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnhv9lh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnhtbht", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnhv9lh", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnhv9lh/"}
