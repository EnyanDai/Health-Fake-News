I don\u2019t need to know how to engineer a highway bridge because I trust that there IS someone who knew how to design the bridge I am about to drive over.\n\nBut politics became infected with science denial, denigration if expertise, dismissal of fact.  People\u2019s lack of knowledge about many technically complex topics have become weaponized by charlatans who are using it to create \u201calternative facts\u201d and conspiracy theories.\n\nWe do ourselves a disservice when we dismiss this phenomenon as simply a natural consequence of an increasingly technical world.  It\u2019s not simply a natural phenomenon, it is a deliberate and calculated maneuver undertaken by people with deep malice and malevolence in their intentions.  We will not survive as a human race if we are unable to free ourselves from conspiracy theorists and science-deniers.  Ridding ourselves of the cancer they\u2019re causing cannot happen if we merely dismiss their malevolent actions as simply \u201cthe natural course of things.\u201d\n\nThings will not get better until we shine a light on the politicians and opinion shows that are fomenting denialism and calling them out publicly as having evil intentions.", "created_utc": 1586027097.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmfh2oc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t1_fmff2u2", "score": 51, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586098771.0, "name": "t1_fmfh2oc", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmfh2oc/"}
