It might seem like or feel like i'm talking down to you because people in general don't react well to people explaining things. That and there's a chance you're just concern trolling but how people elevate the opinions of nazis to be equal with the people nazis want to murder is similar to people elevating antivaxxers/flat earthers with scientists.\n\nPeople almost randomly pick two groups of people and evaluate them both as ONLY expressing an opinion. It doesn't matter that one was and is backed by hundreds of years of countless people checking to see if it's accurate and works out consistently. While the other is just a random thought from people who have absolutely zero training in any area what so ever and have nothing to back up any of what they say.\n\nAt that point. Both being seen as..only an opinion. Opens the door for people who have no idea what they're doing to eat any at logic.\n\nSo much so that anti-vaxxers/flat earthers and nazis who want to murder people have their words treated as valuable.\n\nThe effect of all that? 5G caused covid-19 and people burning down cell towers because others allowed science backed by facts to be considered on the same level of utter bullshit.\n\nScience, logic, morality and etc. Vs. Anti-vaxxers/flat earthers/climate change denial and..nazis.\n\nLogic vs stupidity.\n\nNazis and how people treat what they say is an example of how the whole both sides attempt at an argument has made humanity massively less safe than it was before.\n\nAgain. How people treat illogical, morally repugnant and fucked up views is why we've ended up with people wanting to burn down the only way they have to communicate with others. And i used nazis as an example of how people treat those kinds of ideas and elevate them to a place where they can negatively effect everyone.\n\nDid that help?", "created_utc": 1586941164.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngqgr7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngid5c", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngqgr7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngqgr7/"}
