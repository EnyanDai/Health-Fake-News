On frequencies that have been used for other applications with more energy already. Basically, people near a tower now will get as much energy from radio waves as people further from a tower used to with 3g and 4g. If we were to replace all cell towers with 5g, and even build more, the energy people receive in radio waves from 5g would be as if everyone lived far from a 3g or 4g cell tower. So even with more towers, you'd get less radiation.\n\n\nBut if you need more, read [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/11/01/the-science-of-why-5g-is-almost-certainly-safe-for-humans/#23630a0670e3), [this](https://www.howtogeek.com/423720/how-worried-should-you-be-about-the-health-risks-of-5g/) or [this](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/is-5g-dangerous/).
