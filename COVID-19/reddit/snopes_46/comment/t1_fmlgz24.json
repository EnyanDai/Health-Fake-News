It's just as equally dangerous to assume it is benign as assuming it is dangerous. The facts are that the companies producing this tech are bypassing years worth of safety testing that is supposed to be done in order to make more profit. Of course there will be a billion conspiracy theories about everything (that's by design) it doesn't cause covid-19, but we should all be concerned about the repercussions this could have. Even if it isn't dangerous you should be worried about the utter lack of privacy we will have. It would be incredibly easy with this tech to set up a police surveillance state. The problem is conspiracy theorists get such a bad rep because there's idiots that talk about flat earth and stupid shit like covid19 being caused by 5g.
