As part of an exercise to substantiate the legitimacy, I decided to read the appeal and read some of the studies cited within. The first thing I did was scrolled to the signatories, and researched the very first person listed in my home country of Canada. What did I find on Dr. Magda Havas? Let's start there.  \nSome background on Magda Havas? \u201cDr. Magda Havas, Professor, Trent University\u201d, gives us three strong indicators that turn off our safeguards against unconditionally accepting someone\u2019s opinion: she has a Ph. D., she is a professor and she works at a university. For most people that is enough to accept her credibility, especially when she talks about radiation, a subject we instinctively fear and concerns something highly abstract. However, upon further research, her Ph. D. is in **botany**, giving her no qualifications in the field of medicine or physics. In fact, [this article](https://evilcyber.com/the-rest/havas-wifi-research/) delves in this more, citing a critical response to her theory that WiFi causes adverse health effects from her own colleagues in the Department of Physics at her very own Trent University. \n\nThen, back in 2012, the Office of Science and Society from McGill University found serious inconsistencies with her study on WiFi signals causing heart irregularities. Lorne Trottier, MSc in Electrical Engineering at McGill University, teamed up with Dr. Joe Schwarcz the Director of McGill's Office of Science and Society, and Dr. David Langleben the head of cardiology at the esteemed Montreal Jewish General Hospital attempted to challenge the study published by Havas, and went as far as [Challenging Dr. Havas to replicate her findings by conducting an independent double blind experiment](http://www.emfandhealth.com/Havas%20Challenge.html). Dr. Havas declined the invitation and even doubled down on her theory by claiming that Trottier had ulterior motives due to the personal company he owns which manufactures video cards. She wrongly accuses him of having stake in WiFi devices, which he points out his company [doesn't even make](https://matrox.com/en/). Even so, this experiment would be double blind, which would ensure the findings prove nothing but truth.  \n\nSo, to start, it appears the signatories on this EMF appeal is utter garbage. But let's forget that. Let's look at the studies themselves and form our own opinion.  \nSo the next thing I did was select a random study linked in the article. The article I selected was [the report that claims to prove a significant increase in cancer among animals exposed to EMF](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-011-9307-z). If you scroll down to appendix G, the section responsible for critical analysis of the study, you can find the following quotes by various reviewers:  \n*\"Summary: I am unable to accept the authors\u2019 conclusions.\"* - Michael S Lauer, MD (OER)  \n*\"I think additional experiments are\nneeded to assess if the incidence\tof brain gliomas in male rats exposed to GSM- or CDMA-modulated RFR is significantly higher than\tthe control\tgroup or not.\"*  - Maxwell P. Lee, Ph.D.  \nLast but not least, the final reviewer, R. Mark Simpson, D.V.M., Ph.D., explains in depth the study limitations and inconsistencies within the study itself. He raises several concerns with statistical analysis and historical data. The study was *littered* with false positive results, and to my knowledge these false positives and testing inconsistencies have not been remedied.  \nInterestingly enough, the study showed that females weren't affected and the male rats that were exposed [actually lived longer](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/cellular-phone-towers.html).  \n\nEdit: Spelling", "created_utc": 1586194662.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmlwtqq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fml371n", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586206990.0, "name": "t1_fmlwtqq", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmlwtqq/"}
