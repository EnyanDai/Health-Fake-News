No one here replies to what I say, or talks about the evidence. \n\nYour only defense is, yeah governments lie but I\u2019m not unhinged, you seem unhinged and crazy. So I\u2019m gonna try to make you feel like shit. If we actually talked about the events or the evidence, then you would realize I\u2019m right....I just might start a YouTube channel, I\u2019ve been thinking about doing one.\n\nIt would be to try to bridge the gap between \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d and you people. It will be like a class on \u201cconspiracies\u201d. It would start out with Iran contra, because even you people admit that one actually happened. Then it would go into more recent things that have been proven, but things that people like you still call nothing more than a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t really understand why everyone is being such closed minded assholes in 2020, after they rub this shit in our faces time and time again. You enable kid fuckers like Epstein by doing this.\n\nAlso, what specifically makes you think I\u2019m an idiot?
