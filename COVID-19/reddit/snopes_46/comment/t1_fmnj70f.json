However, to date, with the exception of high-power microwave radiation, which has widely established hazardous effects, the biological effects of microwaves remain controversial. In epidemiology, there is no conclusive evidence showing that microwaves have carcinogenic effects.\"\n\nThose intensity limits for exposure are way way way way, higher than the limit on the spec for 5g. And the frequencies used in 5g have been used for years and years by radio operators everywhere.\n\nAlthough it's third party information, you can dig thru their source list if you want. I'm not going to debate you on individual studies though, Because for every single study you find there's probably 50 others that come up with varying different conclusions and we could just go all day throwing studies we don't really understand at eachother and that's not productive. And anyway even the few(I think the writer found two for it and 5 against it(one of which showed a reduced risk lol)) studies that found a risk between a certain type of brain cancer and mobile phone usage, would probably tell you that your more at risk from people second hand smoke outdoors than by the very specific form of brain cancer they were researching. Which you know, We still let people do.\n\nBesides that none of that has anything to do with it causing fucking respiratory issues? I mean I'll be first to say not a doctor, I study computer science which couldn't be more different lol, but there is literally no feasible way that microwave radiation could cause symptoms like covid-19s symptoms. Except maybe tiredness? But microwaves causing pneumonia really is that like a joke? Because unless they plan on heating up your lungs showhow I doubt it significantly.", "created_utc": 1586227296.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmnj70f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fw14yt", "parent_id": "t1_fmly86v", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586228628.0, "name": "t1_fmnj70f", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fw14yt/at_least_20_uk_phone_masts_vandalised_over_false/fmnj70f/"}
