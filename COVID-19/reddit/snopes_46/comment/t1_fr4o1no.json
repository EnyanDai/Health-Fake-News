Having to defend their position just means their pride gets connected to the misinformation and it has the opposite effect of making them even more attached to the bullshit conspiracy theory.\n\nIf you want to 'argue' with someone like this, I'd recommend only doing it if you know them, and arguing straight for their emotions.\n\nFor instances, when my mother said she read something on facebook about vacines being harmful I just flipped and said if someone didn't vacinate a children and the children died, I'd hate that person forever. She quickly dismissed that idea from her head. I even brought up my nephew.\n\nThere's no logical argument in their head, only in yours. So just make it an emotional argument or no argument at all, if you have no direct appeal to emotion. (ie. it's a meaningless fake science fact, like thinking the earth is flat. It will affect zero part of anyone's life... so just let them be deluded. Coronavirus is caused by 5G? You might as well assume its true, but argue that 5G will save many more lives due to remote surgery with less delay and increased communication speed.\n\nIt's kinda bullshit, but who cares... they clearly love bullshit, might as well make it somewhat truthful bullshit. I'm with them in thinking 5G is kind of a waste of resources... LTE was still perfectly fine for most communications, and fiber worked for the rest. Huaweii and Cisco needed to make money... that's the only reason why they rushed to meet the 2020 self-imposed deadline, but its a waste of resources because it's barely that different from 4G. It's basically just MIMO OFDM in a smaller wavelength. It, however, does not cause breed viruses.", "created_utc": 1589893235.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr4o1no", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr3unca", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr4o1no", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr4o1no/"}
