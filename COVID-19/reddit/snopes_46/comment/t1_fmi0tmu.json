We live in a very developed society, so people are using things all the time that they don\u2019t understand even a little\nbit. Mix that with a little paranoia, a feeling that the ruling classes are happy to let people die for their own profit, and that your government might be corrupt or incompetent, and it becomes quite plausible that a disaster in this scale could be a side-effect of some technological mishap.\n\nOnly a very small sample of the population really has any idea what radiation is, much less EM waves and how they work. This is only the latest thing people have tried to pin on them.\n\nVaccines are another good example of this; hardly anybody who is not a doctor understands the human immune system or how vaccines work, so people like anti-vaxxers pin all kinds of crazy shit to them. Satellites/satellite dishes, cars, even electricity itself - they\u2019ve all been blamed for all kinds of problems.", "created_utc": 1586099916.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmi0tmu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmhy45d", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmi0tmu", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmi0tmu/"}
