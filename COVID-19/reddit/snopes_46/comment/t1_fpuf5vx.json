At worst it was \"9/11 was an inside job!\" The Loose Change people. They evolved to Earth is Flat and even had Flat Cons, but still didn't physically hurt anyone. Now this is a new kind of stupid that's reached critical mass. I don't think it can get any worse from here in the conspiracy theory world. Or can it ? It just feels too much like a GTA game. And even that universe feels tame compared to this one. If you told me ten years ago we would have flat earthers and 5G fearing idiots, I'd laugh at you. I dont like this simulation timeline. It needs a firmware update badly.
