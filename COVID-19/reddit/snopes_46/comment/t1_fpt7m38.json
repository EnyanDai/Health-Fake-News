There aren't....\n\nYes, initially these masts were destroyed by some nutjobs, but then some opportunists jumped the bandwagon. Landowners\n\nThe reason for this is the 2017 Electronic Communications Code. Or more importantly, the powers it grants telecoms operators over private land. \n\nSee when the the British government asked telecoms operators to roll out 5G they responded saying it would be too costly and difficult. They'd need 400,000 new 5G masts, and setting that up will come with exorbitant cost negotiating with landowners and paying the rents.\n\nEnter the 2017 Electronic Communications Code. Section 20 of the new Code grants telecom operators the right to confer a lease agreement forcing property owners to have masts placed on their land. And the premium to be paid for this lease agreement is valued by what the property is worth as space to rent, discounting its value as a mast site. In most instances, these rooftops have no value commercially, or else they'd be occupied already in some form or another.\n\nWhat that has resulted in is landowners being forced to have masts on their building roofs and being paid in many instances as little as \u00a320 a year. \n\nSo what is now happening is some disgruntled landowners are arranging for these masts to be destroyed, and everyone thinking it was done by the 5G crazies.", "created_utc": 1588886278.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpt7m38", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t3_gfbygc", "score": 134, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1588890918.0, "name": "t1_fpt7m38", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpt7m38/"}
