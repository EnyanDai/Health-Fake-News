The one I mention does on face talk about space and other planets being real and I think they show images of a round earth, so my guess is that they are separate. \n\nI have no idea why someone would hide a flat earth conspiracy, but I haven\u2019t looked much into it tbh.\n\nThe rabbit holes one can go down are extremely deep and I admittedly don\u2019t spend enough time to have an exhaustive knowledge of the central beliefs. (Also a lot of it involves videos that tease you with partial information and claim the full story is in other videos, so i imagine they are designed such that you never really get to a complete story, even a fabricated one). It\u2019s a little shocking how well they are designed to be manipulative to a certain kind of person.  The psychology of the videos is actually quite well thought-out so that the content creators make a lot of money.", "created_utc": 1586128735.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmjek1j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmj98ud", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmjek1j", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmjek1j/"}
