The studies that show harm from the non-ionising, non-penetrating frequencies used for 5g are either cell culture studies (no skin) or very high on dose. Even then, in the solar light example, it is the UV that causes damage, which is beyond the opposite end of the visible spectrum to the microwave frequencies we are talking about. Microwaves are less penetrating than visible light.\n\nI'm not trying to get shitty with you. We can disagree without me calling you stupid (I actually made a point of stating that you are not). \n\nSo anyway, the example I gave does not counter my argument. It supports it. High intensity microwave radiation can be dangerous, we both agree on that. What we disagree with is that low intensity is dangerous. The magnifying glass example simply relates that to something we are all already familiar with that displays similar behaviour.", "created_utc": 1586179732.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fml6e3i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmka8bz", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fml6e3i", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fml6e3i/"}
