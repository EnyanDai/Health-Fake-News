Or the Catholic Church, who actively covered for abusive priests. Or how it's pretty much a meme that if you're a child actor in Hollywood then you've been sexually abused.\n\nWe catch one or a few people, and then pretend like they were the only ones, which is pretty clearly ridiculous. In the case of Saville and Epstein both were pretty well known in their circles for this shit, but nobody did anything about it.\n\nNow, I'm not saying there's a cabal or anything, it's more like \"this shitbag makes me money\" or \"I need this shitbag for <reasons>\". The conspiracy is that they seem to be entrenched enough to have the systems of power cover this up for them, yet we keep going after predators on the internet (which, as someone who's actually worked on that problem can tell you it's whack-a-mole at best).", "created_utc": 1586963861.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnhk30a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnh0ex8", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnhk30a", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnhk30a/"}
