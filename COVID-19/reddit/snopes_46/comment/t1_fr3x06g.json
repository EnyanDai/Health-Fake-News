Like, absolutely no clue whether that's something that happens or not. \n\nYou could just have a tiny modicum of trust for your fellow man, and say \"you know, if this 5G thing caused deadly viruses to spread, they probably wouldn't be putting up those towers.  Those people know what they're doing, they designed the towers, after all.  I don't think they would do that. That would be a bad and evil thing to do.\"\n\nAnd just reject it because even if such a thing were POSSIBLE, it would be an insanely diabolical and nonsensical thing to do.  A person who is has *any confidence whatsoever* in society would never believe this for a second. \n\nThey're not just tired people who don't have the energy to think rigorously about science.  They're people who accept at face value that a humanitarian (albeit a poster child for hypercorporate capitalism) is trying to murder people with a virus and he's doing it in cahoots with your cell phone company.  And that the governments and workers and corporations of the world are either not trying to stop this, or are actually helping. \n\nIt's extremely, extremely, EXTREMELY anti-social to think this for even a second and I don't think we should make any excuses or pretend it's not a problem.", "created_utc": 1589868680.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr3x06g", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr3qi1y", "score": 111, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr3x06g", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr3x06g/"}
