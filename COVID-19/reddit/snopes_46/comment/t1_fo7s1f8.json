They were not correct. In fact, the auto industry basically assured the politicians that they prefer the integrity of the EU market to the sales in Britain, leaving the EU with a carte blanche. \n\nAdd to this is that China has a little problem:\n\n>According to the Standard International Trade Classification, imported machinery/transport equipment takes up 71.30% to 93.56% of China\u2019s GFCF from 2009 to 2017. *China\u2019s machinery/transport equipment investment does include cars (not as investment), which was only 2% in 2018. \n\nWhat does Germany exports besides cars? Data processing devices, chemical products, machines, crude oil and electrical appliances. How much of that imported equipment is of German origin? And how reliant is China on that.\n\nGermany also imports more from China than it exports to it and its exports to China only vaguely outperforms its exports to the Netherlands and its 17 million inhabitants. Its distance to the UK exports (you remember, the Brexit issue) is also neglible. \n\nAnd Britain is a European democracy. The UK is not without issues but China has concentration camps, infected the world, stole European companies' IPs and crashed the economy. Going by the precedent of Brexit, I don't think China should look at the German car industry as the savior of their EU trade status quo.", "created_utc": 1587583558.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo7s1f8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rrya", "parent_id": "t1_fo60z28", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo7s1f8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/g5rrya/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo7s1f8/"}
