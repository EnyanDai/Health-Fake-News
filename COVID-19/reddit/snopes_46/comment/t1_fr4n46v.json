Baby Boomers are not some homogeneous group. \n\nWhen I was in my teens in the 70's I was a pretty active Green and went on CND marches in the late 70's and early 80's. The idea of just throwing away stuff that's perfectly good or could be repaired is usually an anathema to many of my generaton, yet the generation that sees nothing wrong with getting a new phone every year and a new console on each iteration thinks that Boomers are the sole cause of the potential environmental catastrophe that we're facing. \n\nI suspect it's because two particular countries, the USA and Australia, had a very affluent baby boomer generation that failed to embrace things like fuel efficiency and green energy. That's not at all representative of the rest of the world. In Europe nearly all the green initiatives were started by people from the baby boom generation. Germany and France in particular led the world in renewable energy. \n\nRupert Murdoch, Donald Trump and people like the Kochs are not at all representative of most people from that generation, they just happen to be wealthy enough that they can use their power to influence the gullible.", "created_utc": 1589892616.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr4n46v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr4c2up", "score": 175, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr4n46v", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr4n46v/"}
