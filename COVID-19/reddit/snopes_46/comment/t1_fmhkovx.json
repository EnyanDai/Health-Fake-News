In particular, the fact that the original, unaltered, image shows the arrest and, so, subsequent prosecution of Corbyn is new information. This new information changes the context of the image and so alters the context of interpreting any subsequent edit. Just because something is disagreeable does not make it a disagreement. I was told by a dear friend that I can be a cunt sometimes. Disagreeable: yes. Disagreement: no.\n\n> Just to be clear, I'm saying there's no logical connection between the \"Corbyn edit is fine\" position and the \"Riley suit is fine\" position.\n\nThat is utterly clear. You see no connection. You do not feel obliged to live in a world in which logical consequences are *always* applicable. Completely clear. It just means you cannot understand the point I made for the simple reason that you do not believe Logic is anything more than a frivolity. This is fine. This is the way a huge number of people have thought in the past, think now, and will think in the future.\n\nThe failure to suppose that logic is how the world works is exactly the way that things such as the \"5G Conspiracy\" gains traction. It is the same way that a lifelong anti-racism campaigner can be portrayed as being a racist. Drop logic, even for just a bit, and you are left with believing things.
