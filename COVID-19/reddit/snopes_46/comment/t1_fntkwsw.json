So kind of apples and oranges.   \n\n\nIt is a little funny how these conspiracies came along and now all of these people who don't know a thing about 5G are so confidently on-board, even when you can find scientists and governments around the world voicing concerns. Even in articles trying to dispel conspiracies, every non-alarmist conclusion comes down to \"We still need to do testing on these technologies.\" Ok so lets test... oh wait you already installed thousands of towers... hmm... \n\n  \nA year ago San Francisco was delaying 5G technologies saying that companies need to prove to THEM that the tech is safe, not that they need to prove its unsafe which makes a lot of sense to me because I'm not interested in rushing technologies so corporations can make more money.  You've got the damn EU saying they won't be pressured into rolling out 5G and yet my 22y.o. roommate will go on an angry rant guaranteeing the safety of the technology when she literally doesn't know what the G stands for. This is the power of conspiracy, far more powerful than advertising or debate.  \nI started following this a few years ago and now it's really blown up but I didn't expect it to take the \"legitimacy through conspiracy\" route though. That's a newer, smart move because now I even sound a little crazy talking like I am. Well played.  \n\n\n**TL;DR I'm sure 5G has NOTHING to do with coronavirus but it already has had the \"unintended\" effect of getting a bunch of clueless people 100% on-board with 5G which is nothing but a MASSIVE boon for the companies that already run the world. It's a massively successful PR campaign where the strategy is not focused on advertisement.**", "created_utc": 1587243716.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fntkwsw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnt1qta", "score": -7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fntkwsw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fntkwsw/"}
