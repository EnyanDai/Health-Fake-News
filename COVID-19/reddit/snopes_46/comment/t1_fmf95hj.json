However I think it will be interesting to see the government force job centre workers to do jobs like that if they want to continue to get the dole.\n\nThat is a point I tried to make to someone else on here a while ago. They argued that the food would be subsidised or something like that. Yeah great, so you just tax everyone rather than letting them pay for what they want. People have some pretty cool ideas without thinking them through.\n\nIt\u2019s either that or they\u2019re rich and stand to get a whole lot richter.
