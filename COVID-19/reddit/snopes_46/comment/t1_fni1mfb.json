But that doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee that it\u2019s safe.  You\u2019re surrounded by pollution all the time, but we all recognize that you\u2019d have more health issues if you lived nearer to a factory pumping out that pollution. \n\nDo I think people should be burning down towers? Hell no. But I wonder if maybe these people might have already been \u201cfeeling sick\u201d around them, then \u201cnew 5G\u201d technology rolls out right around the time of a global pandemic, so some people might incorrectly think that 5G is the root of the problem.   \n\nTo be fair, my opinion is colored by history. Scientists and doctors used to think X-Rays were safe,  so the public used them for treating acne and even fitting shoes. It took decades for enough studies to come out showing that overexposure can cause some serious health issues.  So when I see people claiming that technology is having an effect on their health, it makes me wonder if they might be noticing something the rest of us haven\u2019t picked up on yet.", "created_utc": 1586972447.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fni1mfb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnhfn8x", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fni1mfb", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fni1mfb/"}
