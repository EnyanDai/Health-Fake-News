To suggest otherwise is actually moronic.\n\nCell service goes down when towers go down.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/business/energy-environment/california-cellular-blackout.amp.html\n \nhttps://forums.att.com/conversations/network-coverage/no-service-in-my-area-the-att-tower-was-damaged-5-weeks-ago-and-we-still-dont-have-service/5df032e3bad5f2f6064f00d1\n\nJust because someone hasn't died yet doesnt mean it's not extremely likely or increasing the risk. To suggest otherwise is like suggesting certain people shouldn't follow traffic law because they haven't gotten in a wreck yet. Or that we should allow certain hazardous chemicals not to have safety caps because no ones has Injested it yet. Its asinine and not a real argument.\n\nNo one should be charged for laws that dont exist yet. Duh. But they ABSOLUTELY  should make laws that label damage to an public service as an act of terrorism. Its do different from blowing up a power plant, hospital, water tower, or fire dept. \n\nIf you are arguing that communication isn't essential than quite frankly you just dont know what you are talking about. And if you do I'd like to hear your credentials because I have mine. \n\nYou are whining about big government like a typical 10th grader. I'd like to know why you want to defend peoples right to destroy a public service and potentially hurt many people?
