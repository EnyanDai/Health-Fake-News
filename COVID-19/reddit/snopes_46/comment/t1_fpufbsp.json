We're all supposed to be getting smarter, more educated, and able to think critically. Instead, school budgets are shrinking, class sizes are growing, they're teaching to the cookie-cutter state tests, and quality teachers are leaving en masse because they're sick of the administration and poor treatment.\n\nThrow in the excessive cost and financial barriers for higher education in the US, as well as looking down on skilled-labor jobs and trades, and now we've got a real crapshoot.\n\nHow did we get so far only to feel like the rug has been ripped out from under us? Even Australia, where I now live, is moving more and more towards American ideals and having very similar problems in their education system. Parents are forking out thousands a year to put their kids in private schools because the public schools are so stagnant and poor, thus making the problem of properly funding state schools even harder.
