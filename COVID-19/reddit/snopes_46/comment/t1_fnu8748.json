The same argument is made over and over every time a new tech comes out. It has never been true and will never be true.\n\nIf cell waves could cause cancer, we would have seen at least a mild increase in cancer rates, but in fact we have seen a consistent decrease in cancer rate (not survival, in the rate of new cases) since at least 1999:\n\nhttps://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/DataViz.html\n\nFrom 481/10,000 to 436/10,000, a 9% decrease. Despite having dozens of devices that constantly put out radio and low frequency waves, there has been no effect on cancer rates from them. As 5G uses exactly the same frequencies at powers that are, at worst, equivalent to what we already have, there is no logical reason why it would be any different", "created_utc": 1587256556.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnu8748", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnu0y3e", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnu8748", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnu8748/"}
