The problem was everything was inconclusive. And they linked no studies or sources. Its the world health organization ffs this is something i could have made.\n\nThe second one directly states long term exposure is detrimental. Its near the bottom in the synopsis. Making me think we need direct double blind studies on long term exposure.\n\n\nThe third one is 100% irrelevant to anything regarding 5g. Humans create heat and that radiates away from us. Comparing that to the saturation of our surroundings is ludicrous. Ill be honest i skimmed this one if i got it wrong let me know.\n\nThey even say 5g has been a 10 year long journey. That is enough to release studies saying we exposed 1000 rats 100 meters from a 5g antenna and this is what happened then we had another 1000 rats 200 meters away for a year. No offense but i al not a scientist i am a layperson. That doesnt mean i can't keep pace woth a scientific journal.
