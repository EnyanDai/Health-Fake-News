Lurk for 5 years and decide to start engaging, given the import of this particular time in history, and I start arguing with a wall.\n\nFor the last time, I\u2019m not here to write a law review. You can do your own research to see how courts have interpreted section 230, and more generally in common law, publishers versus platforms. The cited section does not support your position.\n\nSome starters from top hits on google for \u201cpublisher v. platform,\u201d since you don\u2019t seem to get it:\n\nSratton Oakmont Inc v. Prodigy Services Co. (1995 WL 323710, N.Y. May 24, 1995).\n-\tprecursor to section 230.\n\nGoogle, Inc. v. MyTriggers.com, Inc. (No. 09CVH10-14836).\n\nAs to the distinction between moderating and editing, I\u2019ve already addressed it. The central inquiry is does it obstruct a viewpoint?
