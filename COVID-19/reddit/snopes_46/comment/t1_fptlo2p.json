Sorry, I suppose I shouldn\u2019t have come at it from a neutral angle.\n\nLet\u2019s start again, can we friend: The UK has also secretly experiment on us. Do you remember the chemical weapons tests in the North Sea? They accidentally infected a bunch of fishermen who ignored the Exclusion Zone. Fishermen got monitored for months in secret to see if they showed any signs of the disease surfacing. When they didn\u2019t, they left. Frightening I know. In WW2 Britain also put people in POW camps so uh. But this is poppycock, you are running around in circles talking about nonsense. The biggest cause has always been about cohesion and levels of wealth of society. Not guns.\n\nAnd Dunblane was a tragedy, yes. But so was the July bombings. The terrorists didn\u2019t use guns there. What has changed? Nothing legal wise because he police are more careful now. When a suspect buys a large amount of suspicious chemicals, suppliers now know to alert the police. Remember a few months back when a mass shooting in a church was stopped early because the church knew they could be targets. They prepared with members. Remember the recent London attack? Terrorist was shot in the head before he killed a single person. Again, people prepared and when he attacked he was put down in good time.\n\n**We can make changes without having to sacrifice rights**. We always have and I don\u2019t know why you need to now suddenly.", "created_utc": 1588893587.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptlo2p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptjbio", "score": -4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptlo2p", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptlo2p/"}
