I have an old friend who is convinced she can cure any disease with quack diets and all manner of expensive supplements (just not the disease she has). \n\nThe worst has now happened, her husband was diagnosed with cancer last year. The cancer was treatable, but they couldn't deal with the idea of needing a colostomy, thought chemo was some kind of 'big pharma' plot, and didn't believe Cancer Research UK's statistics. I was treated to a hail of YT videos on these topics.\n\nThey decided to hold off on treatment and run off to Spain to a quack clinic for 'Advanced Gerson Therapy' at a cost of \u00a35k a week. Fillings were changed due to their imagined 'elemental mercury' content, instructions were provided on moving electrical cables away from the bed, and training given in the ineffective and dangerous [Gerson Diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gerson). They started to spend \u00a3200 a week on vegetables for juicing and smoked 'medicinal' weed on the grounds that this would shrink the tumour.  \n\nA subsequent scan revealed the initial tumour was now non-surgical and the cancer had metastasised into the liver, forming almost a dozen tumours. Judging by the cancer cough he has it's also hit his lungs. I hoped this would snap them back to reality as there was still a remote chance for treatment, sadly that wasn't the case, apparently the spread was due to visiting the wrong clinic not the ineffective therapy. This required them to visit an even more expensive clinic in Mexico.\n\nThe very worst part of all of this is he tells me that he doesn't have time to spend with his kids because he's so busy with the diet. They've now disconnected their Wi-Fi because they believe it, and 5G, is causing vertigo and spreading Coronavirus.\n\nIt's a mess, and it's really sad.
