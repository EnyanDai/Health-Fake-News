Despite the feeling of some people that more research needs to be done, scientific knowledge in this area is now more extensive than for most chemicals. Based on a recent in-depth review of the scientific literature, the WHO concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields. However, some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research.\n\nA ton of research has been done over the last 30 years on the interactions of the radio wave frequencies that are used by 5G and every other mobile phone technology and nothing of clear cut statistical significance has ever been found. On top of that we have never even been able to come up with a plausible interaction where RF could harm people.", "created_utc": 1586147438.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmk8nvv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmk65qq", "score": 17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586155065.0, "name": "t1_fmk8nvv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmk8nvv/"}
