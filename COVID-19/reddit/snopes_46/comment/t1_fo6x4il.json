It's true that panic has no place in an institution that admittedly gives advice to the whole planet, but it's their job to prevent and do research, rather than parrot some communist dictatorship.", "created_utc": 1587568361.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo6x4il", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rr17", "parent_id": "t1_fo5lpfb", "score": 12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo6x4il", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/g5rr17/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo6x4il/"}
