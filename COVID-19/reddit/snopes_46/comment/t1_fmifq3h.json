Apologies if it did. \n\n> Can you apply this theory to the numerous other outbreaks in the last century? Or are they exempt because it doesn't fit your narrative? \n\nNo, of course not all outbreaks can be attributed to 5G as it didnt even exist. Even this case may not be caused by it, the bottomline point I was making is that 5G can affect an immune system which is what so many redditors in this thread are refuting. \n\n>  Also you haven't explained how it is spread so rapidly in countries that have no 5G such as Iran or absolutely minimal 5G such as Spain where it currently has the second most confirmed cases of Covid19 but then on the other hand there are countries that have a decent 5G infrastructure that have a similar or less number number of cases? \n\nAgain, if I wanted to explain how the virus was spread and how it could have started with an immunocompromised patient near 5G, I would just repost the 5 point list that I just posted... but that is besides the point. The point was whether 5G could negatively affect the human body.\n\n> In truth what you say is just that, a theory. No concrete proof. Just a load of mental gymnastics to attempt to connect the dots \n\nWell now that is condescending. My \"proof\" is the research that is already out there. Take a look at these.
