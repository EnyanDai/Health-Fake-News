Here is some content on the topic-- maybe it will serve one of you well in the struggle against disinformation.\n\n\"In the tumultuous times of Covid-19 people are justifiably perturbed. Consequently, concern and uncertainty have seemingly been manifesting in the form of conspiratorial solutions to the pandemic. People are associating the installation of fifth generation telecommunications technology to the origin and the virulence of a disease. Never before have I seen a particular machination advance so quickly to the forefront of the web. Cursory investigation suggests the explosive growth of this theory is linked in part to government sanctioned disinformation efforts. I will seek to illustrate that link in this case study. The motives for this behavior are likely similar to the 2016 \u201celection meddling\u201d that has been written on far more extensively. Alarmingly, some experts suggest this is \u201ceconomic warfare\u201d because a democratic nation\u2019s progress can be slowed if foreign powers create unease in voters. A politician in the U.S. will be less inclined to advance 5G tech if it means losing the support of their constituents. Similarly, businesses will see less funding if demand lowers. This disruption permits less democratic regimes to advance unimpeded with infrastructure projects while slowing the development of other nations.\"\n\nJournalistic Sources:\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/covid-19-link-to-5g-technology-fueled-by-coordinated-effort](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/covid-19-link-to-5g-technology-fueled-by-coordinated-effort) [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/science/5g-phone-safety-health-russia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/science/5g-phone-safety-health-russia.html)\n\n[https://time.com/5818574/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-inaccurate/](https://time.com/5818574/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-inaccurate/)\n\n[https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-driven-coordinated-effort-200410182740380.html](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-driven-coordinated-effort-200410182740380.html)\n\n[https://globalnews.ca/news/6793733/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-russia-china/](https://globalnews.ca/news/6793733/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-russia-china/)\n\n[https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/04/08/how-5g-conspiracy-theories-used-covid-19-to-go-viral](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/04/08/how-5g-conspiracy-theories-used-covid-19-to-go-viral)\n\n[https://www.cnet.com/news/no-5g-didnt-cause-the-coronavirus-pandemic/](https://www.cnet.com/news/no-5g-didnt-cause-the-coronavirus-pandemic/)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/technology/coronavirus-5g-uk.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/technology/coronavirus-5g-uk.html)\n\nAcademic Sources:\n\nU.
