It was hilarious.  Here go read about it.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton?wprov=sfla1\n\nIt was legitimate something that he believed and he wrote about it in poems and his biographies. He thought he had fought in 14th century Bohemia and a roman legionnaire as well.  Now that is a great conspiracy that deserves research.  \n\n----\n\nAnyway, I've been to Eastern Europe and I met plenty of Romanians and Polish people.  Those Soviets must really suck at genocide or you must be full of shit.\n\nBut I didn't meet a single Jewish person in Germany.  And I know they existed because I've seen Albert Einstein and watched videos on him.  All those Jewish Germans must have gone somewhere and luckily we have historians to research it. Luckily we have a subreddit where you can ask questions and get answers from real actual historians! Crazy I know!
