I also think that the \u201c5G causes coronavirus\u201d conspiracy theory is being falsely perpetuated in order to make people who question 5G to look like tinfoil hatters. I just saw a post on the front page the other day about a woman opening fire near a cell tower, but the title incorrectly reported it as an anti 5G conspiracy theory motivated attack but it actually had nothing to do with it and the vast majority of the comments were calling her an idiot. It seems like people on reddit are blindly accepting 5G and the cell companies are likely loving the way people are demonized on here for questioning it at all. I have had people call me equivalent to a flat earther or anti vaxer on here for questioning it, but the jury is still out on it and anecdotal evidence like bees dying near the towers is scary. Phone companies also have an incentive to suppress information that is critical of it. I would not want to live near a 5G tower until there is very extensive research on its long term effects. I am not saying I know that 5G is bad or am deadset on my opinion of it, I just have concerns and wish there would be more longitudinal studies on its effects", "created_utc": 1587631907.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo9uryi", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g6afbr", "parent_id": "t1_fo8unok", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3jayp", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo9uryi", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/g6afbr/tati_posts_about_5g_during_a_time_of/fo9uryi/"}
