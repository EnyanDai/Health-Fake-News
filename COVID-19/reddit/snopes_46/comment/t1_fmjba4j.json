I am not convinced, I am saying that it deserves more study. \n\n\nHow many PhD's do you think there are that study the effects of non-ionizing radiation on microbiology? I don't know the number...but I wouldn't necessarily say that 240 is not the majority. \n\n\nThe studies are all viewable in PubMed - it shows who ran the study and details on it. Reputable sources like \"Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University\" and sources with n=1000+\n\n\nIf a scientist took the time to craft an experiment in the field that they are in mastery, then who are we to say it is worthless? Isn't it worth more study? \n\n\nI agree - it is difficult to know what is going on - even in the scientific world. All we can do is....more science! \n\n\nThis would not have to be any kind of conspiracy, just normal government negligence. How long did science say that cigarettes were harmful before the government acknowledged it? Decades?\n\n\nI want more science. If there is a possibility that something can harm us, then we should study the shit out of it.", "created_utc": 1586126801.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmjba4j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmj7lt7", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmjba4j", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmjba4j/"}
