This is how airport scanners work, 30GHz-300Ghz em waves pass through cloths and bounce off skin and any foreign objects. If it worked like you think, frequent flyers would be literally microwaved to death.\n\nC - studies were done directly on cells without the usual protective casings - if 5G signals can impact your brain cells/testicles/ovaries directly, I suspect you have bigger things to worry about than cell membrane damage. \n\nD - a 5g signal can be blocked entirely by your hand. It's this reflectivity that's needed to get signal out of direct line of sight, otherwise literally every point in the country would need direct line of sight to a tower.\n\nThe 60GHz thing that's been latched onto is that a 60GHz signal is attenuated by oxygen. The loons have decided that this absorption changes the composition somehow, and makes it unusable by the human body.", "created_utc": 1586194274.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmlw2ah", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fw14yt", "parent_id": "t1_fmlsiqw", "score": 21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmlw2ah", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fw14yt/at_least_20_uk_phone_masts_vandalised_over_false/fmlw2ah/"}
