They lie about practically everything.  Politicians lie all the time.  Government agents commit crimes and never get in trouble for it.  People who expose these lies and crimes, such as John Kiriakou or Chelsea Manning or Edward Snowden or Julian Assange, end up being branded enemies of the state.  John Kiriakou exposed CIA torture and went to prison.  Gina Haspel covered up CIA torture and was appointed director of the agency.  The \"State Secrets Privilege\" was created by legal precedent in a case where the government was lying about there being any state secrets to protect.\n\nIn the UK, Boris Johnson just got Brexit after a years-long campaign of lying to everybody about how great it would be for the UK.  A few weeks ago Trump was promising that the virus would just disappear.  Last month Johnson was boasting about how he's still shaking people's hands.\n\nSo now the government says \"There's this thing that's killing people but here are steps to take,\" some part of you has to wonder whether they're lying again.  Some of the things our leaders have been saying about the virus have apparently been false, and they don't even try to be self-consistent.  The government has worked hard to earn the distrust of the citizens, and so when someone says \"they're lying to you,\" there's lots of reason to believe that they are.\n\nYour family friend reached out to you, someone she trusted.  She did that because she didn't trust the official word from the government, and she was **right** not to trust the official word from the government.\n\nEDIT: and so I've been downvoted for saying that governments lie all the time, even though everybody over the age of about 15 knows it's true.
