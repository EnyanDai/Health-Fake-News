Capitalism absolutely corrupts.  The push for individualism and constant growth, as well as constant accumulation will inevitably reward the most sociopathic people to rise to the top and then use the institutions of power (bought by great wealth) to give themselves even more power.  It happens literally every time, and has already happened in the US.\n\nThe thing is, wealthy businessmen/women do continue to accumulate wealth, which they use to buy power, which they use to buy government.  This has been happening in the US for 100 years, and its patently obvious today when we look at our government and the policies.  \n\nTrue communism is possible, but its unlikely it'll be called by that name due to the failure that was the USSR.  The thing is, it'll happen when we realize we're post scarcity and shift the way we approach economics and jobs.  All we can do is set ourselves up along the way for whatever is next.  I don't think anyone can rationally say capitalism will last forever.", "created_utc": 1586567792.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn1qjh7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fn1dbnm", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn1qjh7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fn1qjh7/"}
