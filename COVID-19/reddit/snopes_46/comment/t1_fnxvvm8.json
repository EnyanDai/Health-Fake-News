Dude I can't teach you high school level biology. If you don't understand this there is no possible way I can make you understand, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how physics works.\n\nThere are no molecules in radio waves. Radio waves are energy, not matter. That article you linked has literally nothing to do with what we're talking about because it's about physical objects like chemicals.\n\nThe closest analogy I can think of would be a pane of tinted glass. Obviously, it does not reflect the majority of the light, or anyone outside the window would be blinded; what it does is absorb the light, meaning less of it reaches you inside the vehicle.\n\nIf you had actually read the other studies you're linking, you would have seen that the DNA damage and such that was seen in the results was due to heat. Basically, the radio waves were microwaving their cells. And that temperature change was about 1-2 degrees C.\n\nThe skin is much more heat resistant than any internal organs or cells. A rise in skin temp of 1-2 degrees is not going to do any damage. That's why you can wash your hands in water that's 120 degrees or so, and why you can stand around a campfire without burning yourself. \n\nBut honestly, if you don't understand this part, I'm afraid you'll need to go take Biology/Physics 101 because I can't explain it to someone who doesn't even have a basic knowledge of the subject, sorry", "created_utc": 1587347455.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnxvvm8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnxoqym", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnxvvm8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnxvvm8/"}
