I know there have always been different theories and people have been inclined to believe such stories. Moreover, I knew some individuals, but all of them, hmmm..., let\u2019s say, they were a little bit unusual. But these days, with this virus specifically, I've seen these comments (on social networks) from people I would never have expected to believe that. What is the reason for that? Fear of the unknown? The inability to change anything and maybe therefore they begin to believe in these things? Don't get me wrong, I'm open to all topics. I do not find it wrong to discuss anything, including the impact of the radiation of new technologies, but this is in the same line with the debates such as the impact of the French Revolution on the further development of Europe and the world or any other issue. So I expect some kind of conversation where each party's opinion will be based on some kind of evidence, or if there is no empirical coming, then at least based on logical arguments. These individuals simply collect pieces of different stories and bring them together into a quasi-coherent story that supposedly makes sense. This is dangerous for so many reasons.", "created_utc": 1586173171.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkybw5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvnxyq", "parent_id": "t3_fvnxyq", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkybw5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ireland/comments/fvnxyq/no_5g_does_not_spread_coronavirus/fmkybw5/"}
