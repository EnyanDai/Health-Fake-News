If he hadn\u2019t UKIP may well have transitioned into a dominant political force in politics. \n\nThe truth is if the upper class hadn\u2019t been lying and deceiving the British people for generations we would probably have left the EU much sooner. \n\nBrexit was inevitable not because of foreign interference conspiracy theories but because you can only hold back a wall of popular public opinion for so long before your hands are tied and you are trapped with no where else to go.", "created_utc": 1587256194.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnu7lua", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3iinm", "parent_id": "t1_fnsx73n", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnu7lua", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/g3iinm/uk_moves_to_drop_huawei_as_5g_vendor_citing_china/fnu7lua/"}
