I used to be against censorship and believed that people would easily see through BS - but most of those crazy conspiracy videos are loaded with upvotes, and they often radicalize people who had a \"well I don't really know, but this guy said something that sounds believable (to the uninformed mind)\" opinion at first - and then the viewers lock themselves into that belief. Look at how BS much of religion is, and how vehemently people believe and defend it - many of them price themselves on their faith, and by definition faith is impervious to logic - that's what faith is, it by definition is something that a person believes despite logic (if someone believed it based on logic and evidence, it wouldn't be faith).\n\nBy allowing BS to be up, you allow it to spread. By allowing it to spread, you let more people fall under it's sway. Just look at how many people thought Obama wasn't born in the US or had an illegitimate birth certificate - that's a blatantly and obviously BS claim that a bunch of people believed.", "created_utc": 1586128529.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmje7dk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmi56gd", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmje7dk", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmje7dk/"}
