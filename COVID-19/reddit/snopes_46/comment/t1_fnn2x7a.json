If there were something they would love to be the ones to shed light on it.  There isn't something and they run the risk of spreading this misinformation and getting more innocent linesmen hurt.  \n\nIt's scary topically to not have control over what frequencies you're exposed to.  I get that.  \n\nThere is no science out of those 40 years to suggest this is a problem.  That was my reason for pointing out that the FCC had to clear those frequencies.  They took them from companies already using them.  \n\nThe microwave analogy was to point out that the same frequencies people are scared of for that name come out of your router.  The difference is power.  Similar to how someone tossing you a bullet is different from you getting shot is a matter of power.  One does not have the ability to hurt you what so ever and the other will kill you.  \n\nWhere you upset me is by preaching this nonsense while clearly not understanding the science behind it.  That's not a jab at your intelligence, I wouldn't expect you to know.  However not understanding the term bandwidth shows me you have a lay understanding of the science.  At best you're stifling progress and at worst you're supporting arson and violence due to ignorance.", "created_utc": 1587083273.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnn2x7a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnn1hxg", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnn2x7a", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnn2x7a/"}
