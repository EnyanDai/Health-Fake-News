This isn't about a theft of agency from the masses\u2014I certainly don't have the power to \"remove\" someone's ability to hold an opinion. Rather, it's about teaching future generations how to be rational, and to learn instead of simply *deciding*.\n\nWhy bother to become better informed if you can simply form an *opinion* that is every bit as valuable as it would be after becoming so informed?\n\nYou can claim that an opinion only matters to the holder, but that is nonsense. It is such utter nonsense that I cannot believe you would even make the claim. \n\nThe problem isn't so much that people hold opinions, it is that they treat opinions as a \"protected class\" of idea. That protection, they believe, shields them from criticism, the search for further knowledge, or ever having to change their mind\u2014or even allow someone to try to change it. It allows them to do harm to others using that *opinion* as the basis of their actions. It further encourages them to believe that their opinion is somehow *valuable*, even when it is demonstrably not.\n\nThat is what I do not believe people are entitled to. While neither I nor anyone else can \"remove people's entitlement to opinions,\" you may note that we already make it illegal to *act upon* opinions when those actions cause harm to others. We just do so incredibly selectively, and based largely upon the number of people who share them. We fought a civil war over such an opinion.", "created_utc": 1587260702.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnuf7nk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnthqxe", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnuf7nk", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnuf7nk/"}
