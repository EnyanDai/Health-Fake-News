That's the whole argument. You don't suddenly become capable of rational decision making just because you managed to survive for 18 years. At least a test measures something useful, whereas age merely measures being able to breathe and eat and not walk into traffic.\n\n>I feel like people like you that push for these authoritarian measures and stripping away of rights never consider that one day they might be used against YOU.\n\nWe do though.\n\n>Maybe you\u2019re not considered smart enough to vote.
