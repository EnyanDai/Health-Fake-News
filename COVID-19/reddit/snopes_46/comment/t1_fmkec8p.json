This is violating freedom of speech.\n\nWhat does this even mean?\n\nIf it should be getting done, then it's not violating freedom of speech. If it's violating freedom if speech, then it shouldn't be done.\n\nWhere do you draw the line? Say it with me now:\n\n*Every legal right is backed by an equal and opposite moral responsibility.*\n\n \\- Newton's third law of sociodynamics\n\nThe right to freedom of speech is not, and has never been, absolute and unrestricted. That's true even in the US, which traditionally has stronger free speech laws than other countries. (And correspondingly weaker protections against the use of speech as a weapon of abuse and harassment.)\n\nSo, no, this isn't a violation of freedom of speech. Not least because the right to free speech means that Youtube has no obligation to broadcast content that they do not agree with. Freedom of speech is what *protects* Youtube's right to act in this way, not forbids it.\n\nBut it's also not a violation of freedom of speech because Youtube is not being compelled to act by anyone. They're simply voluntarily choosing to (finally) take their social responsibilities seriously, after an earnest request.
