(the band that 5G is in). I don't condone burning down towers, but these towers also shouldn't be forced on the citizenry like they are. ( one has been built in my neighborhood in the last week.)\n\nThere aren't studies yet on the \\*HIGH POWER\\* versions of this, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know it won't be pretty when those come out.\n\nStudy number 1: This study shows that low power millimeter wave RF disrupts neuronal activity and firing:[https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4233276/](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4233276/?fbclid=IwAR2V40S42i_c7aDqUIkl4AKlBz4CjqhbNoU0zSEgH7ITV9ZjKQLZLm04KpE)\n\nStudy number 2: This study indicates that those low power MMW frequencies disrupt cellular metabolism and structure. They were trying to use it to inhibit cancer growth:[https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16959547](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16959547?fbclid=IwAR3DGmhLkJpZBNgUny_c9DtxptEmA19PplK40Y29zHDaewqJY_poAHfgu4A)\n\nStudy number 3: This study indicates that 0.1Thz (100Ghz) frequency exposure for 2 hour and 24 hour trials induced genomic instability of chromosomes 11 and 17. This suggests that such exposure may result in an increased risk of cancer[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18666810](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F18666810%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2JvnZIFUC5muckV6WwWOSdebr-9M8hNMLMKmOThoaTyQuTLWaS61TLIso&h=AT0ICZjOzllPK971XiWtfa4rTA9h50v8gDAKwJebBl7m-ia6afjMrGCZSjT5xfrdNNQ6sbGcpvlqCEdA0-tbtYLlLqSVj-TnU3Ye_cFIfAhCLkfIsoBX6F6TivYcQXR6EOkI4-t5kl71Czcw5cbziuY9GRXE)\n\nAnd to reiterate, we're gonna be dealing with \\*HIGH ENERGY\\* versions of this. 5G uses Beamforming (focus of many small antennaes to project a beam directly at a targeted user) Every antennae used will exponentially multiply the dB a user receives. This video [https://youtu.be/xGkyZw98Tug](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FxGkyZw98Tug%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2EFba_x0I0XsayPCHgm09FbBMBYEp6V8fMYPoD2TMkbEqfmkYWwFpkbcM&h=AT22E6ENV0nT_TbUAgDjZ2z4BqjM5pplL283wJSB-Bx4UZB2UNxGznHwvW-KxEk1q5H3aIPdhkwdICsppvtUUlTn9T6y2q6hG7iY_yAz3Y8SWpfvLSDl8EzsQBcwWWFfrYdLKbM8r073QeJB2RcBj9H4Mif_) does a great job at explaining this concept in detail\n\nThese human health effects start at 3-6 microwatts of energy. These antennas beam 1400-2000 microwatts anywhere in their line of sight, and at least 200+ microwatts through the first walls they hit (up to concrete, metal is more resistant)\n\nThanks for reading. I'm sick of being called a luddite for not liking the fact they are putting these up in every street corner of my neighborhood. When high energy studies are made, yall will regret ever laughing at the people concerned from this.\n\nEDIT: I guess reddit continues to hate science :)", "created_utc": 1586919627.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fng0q7y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "score": -16, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586966777.0, "name": "t1_fng0q7y", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fng0q7y/"}
