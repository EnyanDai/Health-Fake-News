Shit, I taught myself how to use a multi meter to test components on a circuit board on my nephews xbox pcb, all I needed was a breakdown of the board from the internet so as to know what the components should read out on the multi meter and if they were bad, and then how to replace and what parts to replace from same breakdown, all in a weekend-which over the years has brought me to a stronger, but nowhere professional, level of knowledge in electronics and has led to many things being fixed around the house-but thats just me personally. and that was coming from a change out the ceiling fan, and replace a power outlets type background in electricity. The point is, the information SHOULD be out there, and if ANYONE caught a wild hair and wanted to dive into that world, all it would take is a breakdown and a search engine to learn the rest. Why make it this hard? why \"let\" people just burn down expensive equipment and not just put it ALL out on the table, literally and figuratively. It just seems like there is something to hide if they wont even do that. and \"not many companies make the recievers/transmitters....\" I don't care what the reasons are, if the technology has the potential, in ANY way, to be dangerous and is \"forced\" upon the public without \"consent\"\n. then the technology needs to be fully transparent to anyone who chooses to know the information, simple as that.", "created_utc": 1586872777.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fndlobz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g0rx6e", "parent_id": "t1_fndjl2x", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586873765.0, "name": "t1_fndlobz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/g0rx6e/5g_tower_fire_in_italy_during_coronavirus_lockdown/fndlobz/"}
