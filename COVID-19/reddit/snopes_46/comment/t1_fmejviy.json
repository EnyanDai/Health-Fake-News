Gaining press and attention as the face of the \"Bypass Swindon \u2014 Don't build a bypass in Swindon\" movement, she moved into politics when invited to join the short lived Socialists for the United Kingdom.\n\nHer time at SUK did not go well after a litany of scandals. However, she did become a \"face\" of tabloid drunk-celebrity-falls-out-of-a-cab-and-snogs-an-Earl pages. Gaining notoriety in the celeb world, and moving increasingly in exclusive circles (she was once a favoured companion to Prince William) she penned the memoir *I've Seen All of You - You've Seen All of Me*. The book would become the template for celeb tell-alls in the future and also the lining for thousands of rabbit hutches.\n\nIn a quirk of history, as a guest on *David Walliams Gropes the Stars*, she was invited to fill in as the host was heavily pregnant. Her presenting career had begun and would go on to flourish, as she became a household name in hits like *Britain's Got Gout*, *Nasty Nigel's Perform or Die* and Cowell's famous *Dance, Bitch! Dance!*. \n\nThe early days of dreadlocks, nose piercing, didgeridoos and Chumbawumba tattoos now all gone. The whiff of cheese and pickle sandwiches replaced with Chanel.\n\n[eta] Source: My ~~arse~~ elbow.", "created_utc": 1586006211.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmejviy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuh83m", "parent_id": "t1_fmddjub", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586006438.0, "name": "t1_fmejviy", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fuh83m/telecoms_engineers_are_facing_verbal_and_physical/fmejviy/"}
