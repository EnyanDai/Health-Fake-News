Sadly this normally makes them more entrenched in their ignorance. Remember, a big part of why they believe these things is the feeling inadequacy and lack control over their lives. Calling them out just forces them to double down because you are triggering all the memories they have of being made a fool of or embarrassed earlier in their lives.\n\nI recently tried to have the conversation politely with an aquaintence that is anti-vaccine and keeps spouting that shit off to anyone that will hear it. He has a non-verbal autistic son and all he really wants is an explanation why his son is that way and no-one but these nut jobs is giving him an actual answer, wrong as it is. He's not really stupid either, he's just desperate and hurt, and I can't really bring myself to shout him down knowing that. I can't be around him though either, and even though i know that's just making it worse for him, if I can't get through to someone, I also can't deal with listening to them try to spread their misinformation to others.", "created_utc": 1588894585.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptni28", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt8ufp", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptni28", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptni28/"}
