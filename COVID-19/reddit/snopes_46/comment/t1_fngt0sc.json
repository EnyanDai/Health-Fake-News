That\u2019s not a strawman argument. That\u2019s a direct dismissal of your ridiculous suggestion.\n\nBTW, The first result of the google search has the following study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6765906/\n\nI read the conclusions for the craic and it says the following:\n\nRegarding the health effects of MMW in the 6\u2013100 GHz frequency range at power densities not exceeding the exposure guidelines the studies provide no clear evidence, due to contradictory information from the in vivo and in vitro investigations.\n\nRegarding the possibility of \u201cnon-thermal\u201d effects, the available studies provide no clear explanation of any mode of action of observed effects.\n\nRegarding the quality of the presented studies, too few studies fulfill the minimal quality criteria to allow any further conclusions.\n\nYour suggested study says studies that are available on the subject are inconclusive, limited in number and typically don\u2019t control for thermal effects which is the one biological impact of EM as the absorption of radiation causes an increase in temperature which is already well known. \n\nBTW, while you have your ham radio license, I funnily enough have a actual degree in electrical engineering I\u2019m well aware of the effects of EM. But honestly it doesn\u2019t take a degree to spot the bullshit your spouting.\n\nSo climb down of that high horse of yours and stop spreading shite on the walls.", "created_utc": 1586943863.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngt0sc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g14cs6", "parent_id": "t1_fngqguj", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngt0sc", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/g14cs6/coronavirus_ireland_5g_arsonists_target_mobile/fngt0sc/"}
