Sorry to toot my own horn but I'm a pretty fast reader, I can read quite a bit faster than I can speak. \n\nIf it's an \"and finally\" story I might not delve into it too much, but anything to do with geopolitics/economics/science etc. I'l spend 5-10 minutes reading a few articles from various sources. \n\nBut I can totally understand that it could get dull - one of my really good mates is smart as hell, but reads so slowly that he finds trouble with subtitled foreign films.\n\nAlso I do read the stories and comments on less reputable sites, just because I find them quite funny - and they also give you an idea of how a certain demographic views the issue in question. I think you should try and keep up with the news if you can, and stick to the least sensationalist sources. \n\nI dislike getting news from any sort of video, unless it's something like a live feed from a warzone. Or perhaps an expert in the studio giving their opinion. Generally I much prefer reading what reporters have to say, rather than watching a video.", "created_utc": 1586106126.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmib9hi", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmi5zal", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmib9hi", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmib9hi/"}
