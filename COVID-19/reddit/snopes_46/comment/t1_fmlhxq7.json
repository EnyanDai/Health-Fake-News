In this case though, they choose to handicap themselves. If they don't use their brain, don't do the due diligence to actually research what's going on and then proceed to act on misinformation without considering the consequences then yeah, they are mentally handicapping themselves.\n\nBesides, I don't particularly like demonising words. Obviously there are plenty that are off limits, but some are just a matter of culture. Take the word Cunt for example. Insult for the vast majority of places, both an insult and an endearing term in Australian culture. Retard, or tard, always used to be the same for me and my friends. It wasn't used to say \"you have a mental condition\", it was generally more in line with \"you are being dimwitted\", which actually is more in line with using it to mean slow. We don't have to agree, it's just my take on it.", "created_utc": 1586186764.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmlhxq7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmlg9w4", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmlhxq7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmlhxq7/"}
