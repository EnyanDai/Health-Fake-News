I do not believe in it, but will present the justification below without my own commentary. \n\nPart of their argument is that the evil beings cannot actually act against us without our consent, but rather convince us to allow ourselves to be controlled via ignorance.  This is why the deep state allowed Donald Trump to be elected even though they are all-powerful. The reason they cannot hurt us without our consent is because there will be karmic repercussions if they do so.  As a result, they can only control us via mechanisms that we choose (watching and believing the mainstream news, drinking water and taking medication that is poison, fixating on financial goals that perpetuate the current economic system for the benefit of our own egos, and now they are saying that the next form of control will come via the vaccine, which many people will voluntarily opt into.).\n\nThe above, while not something I believe in, does actually present an interesting rationale for how the deep state is both all powerful and also not able to squelch their movement.  They argue that we can be free from their control if we essentially \u201cawaken ourselves\u201d to what they believe to be the truth.  I do have to give them some amount of credit because it\u2019s a clever (albeit very likely false) rebuttal to that paradox.", "created_utc": 1586121649.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj2e3s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmiqj94", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj2e3s", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmj2e3s/"}
