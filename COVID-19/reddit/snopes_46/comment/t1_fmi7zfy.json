Simply put, 5G will interrupt with that frequency to our detriment.

I will not do your research for you but I\u2019ve listed two materials supportive of the conclusion that 5G is a threat, not just to health but to mankind in general. It requires you to \u2018connect the dots\u2019. \n\n5G will pave the way to the internet of things where every object (sentient or not) is connected to this internet of things. That means handing over a lot of your personal data (where you walk, what time you take a shit, how much money you\u2019ve spent, how many droplets of water you\u2019ve used in your shower). It centralises everyone\u2019s movements.
