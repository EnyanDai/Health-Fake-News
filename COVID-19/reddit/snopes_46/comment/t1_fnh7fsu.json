From an evolutionary perspective our species adapted so well because we saw patterns (e.g., we could recognize the seasons and learn to plant/harvest crops) and this instinct to seek out relationships still exists. \n\nNot making a commentary on religion, but it's a similar thing. The need to explain these patterns we see and produce a \"reason\" for the unknowns in our life. Certain people are more prone to seek out relationships and it's helpful to explain them with a god (e.g., a hurricane strikes and the look for what bad thing the people of a country had been doing to explain it). Others decide to explain it by attributing negative experiences to government plot.
