We always had the occasional one who went around talking about this but **now they've found each other.**  More people who believe the same nonsense.  And they're having conferences where they all get together.  And this is where the behavior gets interesting.  They're no longer alone, shunned and socially isolated.  They found somewhere to belong, and be accepted.  This is why they absolutely will not listen to any objective evidence that refutes their belief system.  To accept any of that would immediately eject them from this group.  They'll have to leave and most likely be socially isolated once again.  This is why it's so difficult to get them to see how wildly inaccurate their views are.", "created_utc": 1587054841.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnljyxx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnl31zj", "score": 22, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnljyxx", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnljyxx/"}
