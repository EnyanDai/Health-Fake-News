On FB and Insta, she\u2019s been going on multiple rants of how the virus is fake, that the people of Papa New Guinea where she went on a missionary to has no cases (well no crap! They don\u2019t have access to testing and they most definitely have it) and it\u2019s because they have faith in God. She also says the Bill Gates is the one behind the virus so we will be injected with a vaccine that has microchips in it to control us as stated in the Bible. She thinks that his last name correlated to the Gates of Hell. I ignored her until she started to talk shit about my sister (who was trying to convince her otherwise since she did take the girl under her wing in high school) and my uncle (who is a well-trained doctor who updates our family about the virus and it\u2019s symptoms/conditions) on her insta. I basically called her out on how low it was to talk shit about my family and how she shouldn\u2019t believe in these stupid conspiracy theories. She told me that she didn\u2019t disrespect my sis (liar) and did not apologize for insulting my uncle and saying \u201cIf doctors ain\u2019t healing, they\u2019re stealin.\u201d She also told me that basically I\u2019ll perish for my lack of knowledge. I just told her in the best, appropriate way possible to go screw herself. I honestly don\u2019t care if she gets the virus (and I bet she will because she thinks wearing masks and staying inside is stupid).
