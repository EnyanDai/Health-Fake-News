Your argument is that Daily Mail is always full of shit but can you point to what is wrong about the story on the front page right now? What is YOUR argument even supposed to be? You are implying that all their stories are completely inconsequential and just looking to villify muslims. Can you back that up with actual articles or did you just make it up?  \n \nYou are downvoting me for even mentioning a terrorist attack reported by daily mail\u0323. So what are the news that CAN be mentioned according to you?  \n \nI'm not starting anything. Back up your claim or be quiet.  \nLet's face it, you are offended that I mentioned a terrorist attack you want buried because it's inconvenient for your narrative and agenda. Let me guess, you are going to call me racist next, aren't you?
