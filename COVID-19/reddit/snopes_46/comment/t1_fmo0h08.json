This \"study\" basically says \"well, we blasted it with as much EMF as we could then put it through a series of tests... and we dont think that the tests alone could have made these tiny changes, so we guess that maybe it was the EMF\"\n\nOh, and its kind of weird that the same website that published that study also made 5G its top Technology of the year 2020, no? https://www.nature.com/collections/cgjcfcihdc Cool story.\n\nSecond article is a blog that was discredited on the very same website 2 weeks later: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/dont-fall-prey-to-scaremongering-about-5g/\n\nNeat.\n\n3rd article is still talking about fucking Smart Meters. Come on man. He's talking about how 5G communicating with the internet-of-things is some enhanced hazard... then he jumps right into the dumbest thing out of all of your \"evidence\": 3 ambulance drivers killed themselves after exposure to 5g... something plenty of people are exposed to every day who dont kill themselves. I cant imagine any reason an EMS worker would be depressed... turns out I dont have to tho, because it was revealed in the same article that the drivers were in a toxic job with an abusive manager... so the article then blames the abuse on 5g...\n\nI dunno about you, but thats a lot of straws to grasp at to try and prove a fact.\n\nAnyway, its not going to kill anyone, just like Smart Meters, 4g, cellphones, tv, or radio didnt kill anyone.
