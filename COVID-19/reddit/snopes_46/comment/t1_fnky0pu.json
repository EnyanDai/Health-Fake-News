Not that most of it is easy to understand. But for all the crazy jargon (I'm hardly computer literate, so it's usually just random word fragments to me), at least you can chuck it into a google search and (usually) get a step by step guide how to unfuck it. Which might be a decade old and irrelevant to today, so that's a thing to look out for. At least, though, there is the pretty much ubiquity of support.\n\nThen there's also the package management aspect. You're not downloading random stuff off the interwebz, you're adding repositories, that have been checked by real people who cared about their own systems. So nearly everything you *can* install will be virus-free, as long as it's open source. Nearly typed 'suppositories'... nope, that's something else entirely. I haven't used a virus scanner in 10 years, because I've had no reason to. Malware *can* exist on Linux, but your chances of finding any are slim to none, which I'd argue makes it *more* grandma-friendly than having the rigmarole of trying to explain regular virus scanning, defragmenting and other system maintenance you need on Windows to keep it from having a heart attack.", "created_utc": 1587042805.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnky0pu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1u6wr", "parent_id": "t1_fnkr61z", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587043330.0, "name": "t1_fnky0pu", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/g1u6wr/vandals_set_50_cellphone_masts_in_the_uk_on_fire/fnky0pu/"}
