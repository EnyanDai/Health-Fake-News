A lot of corporations don't want to pass the opportunity of missing on such a consumer base.\n\n- Developed countries consumers will fight every step of the way the move to cut ties with China if it leads to increased costs. As long as income doesn't grow people won't accept rising prices. It means that countries have to do a lot of domestic work in order to manage that move. \n\nAlso, I'm sorry but saying China is the biggest threat to freedom in our species' history is incredibly short-sighted. During the Cold War, the USSR was just as authoritarian and anti personal freedoms. It fell only 30 years ago. The only reason China seems worse is because technology evolved but technology evolved for us too. \n\nThe fight to keep personal freedom has always existed and will always go on. China's just the new player. If they fall someone else will fill the void, as we see by the resurgence of authoritarian movements all over the globe. We can't be complacent and think that China's the only threat. It's the biggest threat *now*, but others can grow to replace it. India is a good example as these last few years they've been more and more authoritarian and aggressive.", "created_utc": 1586516951.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmzdyng", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fmz6xqx", "score": 28, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmzdyng", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fmzdyng/"}
