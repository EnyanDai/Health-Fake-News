That's what science is. You question what something is or how something works or why it works that way and then you work to answer your question. Question the government. We've seen enough bullshit from them for an eternity so yeah question it and take everything they say with a grain of salt. \n\nHowever, deciding to physically harm people is wrong. Planning on physically harming people based off of a conspiracy theory is wrong. Best of all ignoring blatant and obvious evidence and spreading disproven misinformation is wrong. \n\nYes. Let's question everything and let's discuss things. Let's not discuss beating up the garbage man cause you might think he is a government spy collecting information from your trash. Let's not spit on people doing their job because 5g is scary. Let's not plan domestic terrorism because of an off the wall idea. \n\nThe guy you replied to wasn't even calling for that sub to be banned. Just saying that a lot, not all, of the people there don't use their brain. That's his opinion.
