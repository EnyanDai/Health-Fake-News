Especially with the wealth of information available on the Internet.\n\nThat's why I brought up disinformation. Based on my experience *today* on just this website, it's far easier to be led astray on the internet than to find good information. It's not like a website can tell you, \"Hey! Trust me, I'm right!\" and they can't lie about that.\n\n>My concern about \"coddling\" as I put it earlier is that if ideas like these aren't ridiculed as the outrageous bullshit that they clearly are, it allows more people to get sucked in. If you engage in a debate about something it automatically lends the other side an amount of legitimacy that ideas like these frankly don't deserve.\n\nMy second paragraph is a direct response to that, and the two paragraphs after that are explaining with examples *why* I disagree. People exist out there who attack people for their ideas. This entire discussion started because someone literally attacked the conspiracy theorists and called them losers. I'm explaining to you why I don't think your opinion is correct *because of those people.* Because of this exact situation that we are currently in.\n\nI'm not putting words in your mouth. I'm directly responding to what you're saying.\n\nThe child example was an example to show you why your statement about legitimizing someones beliefs by responding to them doesn't make sense. I thought I made that clear when I said, \"Lets break this down into the realm of absurdity.\" I'm sorry you believed that I literally thought that you would terrorize a child for making a math mistake.", "created_utc": 1588912526.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpugt1g", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpufecq", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpugt1g", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpugt1g/"}
