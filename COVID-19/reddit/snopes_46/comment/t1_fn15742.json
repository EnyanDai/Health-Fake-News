Its definitely not anything to do with \"the left.\"  The left are represented by Bernie's platform, which has little, to nothing to do with identity politics.  Other than the parts that are essential, like working for equity...but its not the monolith of \"all white men are bad\" like liberals push.  The problem is there is no 'left'...look what happened to Bernie and how vilified all his supporters are.  Thats where your real Occupy people went.  The goddamn centrists eat everything up.\n\nAlso, free trade and borders isn't left or right specifically.  Far left would support open borders because you have more in common with working class people of a foreign country than the rich people in your own, and coalitions and \"revolution\" building (not to say violent, but rather political) has to be international and global.   If workers gain power in all countries, it becomes impossible to outsource labor to reduce costs and cause all workers to compete with one another.  Its got nothing to do with 'strong borders' or racism.  Thats from the Left anyway....", "created_utc": 1586555024.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn15742", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fn13wfg", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn15742", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fn15742/"}
