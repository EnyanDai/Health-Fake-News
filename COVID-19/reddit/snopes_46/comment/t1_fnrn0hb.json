Boris has used to a certain extent, the Chinese handling of it as a scapegoat. We had knowledge way before it hit us that it was going to be bad but our government did nothing and lives have been lost because of their incompetence.  Same goes for America where they are using China as a scapegoat. \n\nThat being said we need to cut all ties with CCP and WHO. In the early  days of the virus China were lying about the severity, locking up doctors and continuing to deny the existence of concentration camps. Whilst doing this they were praised consistently for their 'transparency' by the WHO. China and WHO have behaved horrendously and history will remember them for that. \n\nAgain we have countries including our own using them as a scapegoat, but it doesnt change the fact how China have behaved. \n\nYou can be critical of our own governments and CCP at the same time, you dont need to take sides. If you're really thinking of siding with China because our governments have done poorly then you're no different than what you claim to hate.\n\nYou can celebrate this move without supporting the Tories.", "created_utc": 1587194262.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnrn0hb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3iinm", "parent_id": "t3_g3iinm", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnrn0hb", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/g3iinm/uk_moves_to_drop_huawei_as_5g_vendor_citing_china/fnrn0hb/"}
