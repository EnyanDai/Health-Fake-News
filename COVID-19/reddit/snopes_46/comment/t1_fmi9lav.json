U.S. intelligence agencies identified the network as a principal meddler in the 2016 presidential election. Now, it is linking 5G signals to brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors and Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 claims that lack scientific support.\n\n[...]\n\n>RT America taps the ranks of existing anti-cellular activists to wage its 5G campaign. Some have railed for decades against cellphones, power lines and other everyday sources of electromagnetic waves. Much of their work appears not in reputable science journals but little-known reports, publications and self-published tracts, at times with copious notes of dubious significance. They tend to cite each other\u2019s research.\n\nIn the end all you need to do is mobilize the local useful idiots to parrot narratives that end up hurting overall.\n\nBetween starting these kinds of things or merely giving them more popularity it's seemingly not a lot of effort for quite a bit of gain from a Russian perspective.", "created_utc": 1586105173.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmi9lav", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvcjl6", "parent_id": "t1_fmhrotb", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmi9lav", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/fvcjl6/british_5g_towers_are_being_set_on_fire_amid/fmi9lav/"}
