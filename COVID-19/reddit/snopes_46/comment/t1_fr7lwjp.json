It falls off quickly on both ends meaning very few people have IQs less than 85. \n\nIt's a weird metric, though, and puts emphasis on \"book smarts\". i.e. someone with an IQ of 90 can be highly successful in life and is less likely to be depressed. They aren't necessarily stupid, they might not care about grades or schoolwork and the tests have a known bias against minorities...\n\nPeople on the right are brainwashed by propaganda mostly. Many are smart people. It's FoxNews syndrome more than anything. A steady diet of Rush Limbaugh, Ayn Rand, et al. I think certain personality types are more susceptible as well. They're not just stupid, they are purposely ignoring facts, because they don't mesh with their established worldview.", "created_utc": 1589950645.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr7lwjp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr4p2bp", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr7lwjp", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr7lwjp/"}
