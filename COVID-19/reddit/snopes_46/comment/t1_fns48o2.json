As time went on it became clear that Arab leftwing nationalism, led by Nasser in Egypt, was too much of a threat in terms of unifying the Arab world including the oil-rich Gulf states into a powerful bloc and expelling foreign influence, and Israel was a good counterbalance to that, especially after their performance in the 67 war.  So Israel and Iran (when the Shah was still in power) became part of the \"dual containment strategy\", and having Saudi Arabia pour funds into spreading Salafism internationally and issue anti communist fatwas also played a role, as MBS admitted in 2017.", "created_utc": 1587212148.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fns48o2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3iinm", "parent_id": "t1_fnrx2b3", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587212588.0, "name": "t1_fns48o2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/g3iinm/uk_moves_to_drop_huawei_as_5g_vendor_citing_china/fns48o2/"}
