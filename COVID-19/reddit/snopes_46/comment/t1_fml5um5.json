Corporations do not have the right to vote or bare arms. Citizen's United only happened because defining political donations as speech is a grey area which could be argued either way as a right they should be granted.\n\nIf we were trying construct a good society through a veil of ignorance, no one in their right mind would suggest that the first people to fill an open niche in information technology should then have the power to control the basic flow of information throughout society and force it to conform to their own values.\n\nAlso, censorship due to a powerful non-government entity which is protected from competition is just as threatening to Free Speech as censorship by the government, if not more so. Why on earth would you grant unlimited speech rights to artificial structures if doing so suppresses the speech of individual human beings?\n\nTake that weak shit back to Facebook where it might be appreciated.", "created_utc": 1586179354.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fml5um5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fml2bgh", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fml5um5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fml5um5/"}
