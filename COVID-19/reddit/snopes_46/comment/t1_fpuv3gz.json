Unless they're putting in new masts this just looks like a regular broadband upgrade.", "created_utc": 1588924738.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpuv3gz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpttv1w", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpuv3gz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpuv3gz/"}
