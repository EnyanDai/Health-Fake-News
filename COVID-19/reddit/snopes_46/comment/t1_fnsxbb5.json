First I'll state, *I don't believe 5G causes coronavirus.*\n\nIn the viral video my friend sent me (twice!) it's claimed that the virus is a biproduct created from within humans, a response somehow to \"toxins.\"\n\nThe guy goes on to state that the Spanish Flu pandemic was onset by FM and AM radio towers.\n\nHe backs his claim by saying that there was never proof of the Spanish Flu virus being transmitted directly from person to person.  Apparantly, they even tried to make it happen physically with no results.  \n\nI've seen nothing to back these claims.  Unfortunately, I've seen nothing to rebuke them either, which I would like to see.", "created_utc": 1587230570.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsxbb5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "parent_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "score": -3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnsxbb5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/g3n9zq/no_5g_does_not_spread_coronavirus/fnsxbb5/"}
