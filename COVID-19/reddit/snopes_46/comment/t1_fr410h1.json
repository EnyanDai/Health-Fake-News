They see all these towers go up \"out of nowhere\" and immediately get suspicious. \"No one just builds infrastructure anymore unless they have something to gain!\" (In this case, private ventures standing to gain subsribers.)\n\nBut 3G and 4G were just regular towers to them and there were less of them. The old out-of-sight, out-of-mind.\n\nCombine this with a global health crisis against something you also can't see (radio waves and viruses are both \"invisible\") and it's no surprise they started looking for something to blame. They are scared and have poor ways of dealing with the world around them and assigning blame to something gives them an ounce of control.", "created_utc": 1589872196.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr410h1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr3zyvc", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr410h1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr410h1/"}
