But they want to expand into the millimeter range.  Safety is entirely about power level and focus. For instance, your home WiFi and your microwave oven are only separated by 50 kilohertz in frequency. But the power levels are orders of magnitude different. And that's how it works for microwave communication on towers. A tightly focused wave aimed specifically at another antenna can go for 20+ miles with the right power output.\n\nAnd think of your 5ghz wifi also. It's in the same group of millimeter wave devices. Power output is similar to 2.4ghz. 1-2 watts. Your phone is also doing 2 watts.\n\nTowers transmit between ten and fifty watts. Dangerous if you're up close for an extended period, but your microwave oven is between 800 and 1200 watts.  See the difference?\n\nThe US Army's active denial system can transmit up to 100 kilowatts to fry people from a distance. That operates in-between wifi bands.", "created_utc": 1587043152.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnkyja1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnkvd2s", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnkyja1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnkyja1/"}
