While some nations including Italy and Portugal have been enthusiastic backers of Belt and Road, another program known as Made in China 2025, whereby Beijing seeks to become the world leader in key technologies, is seen in many quarters as a further threat to European industry.\n\nWith stock prices tumbling on the coronavirus crisis, countries including Germany that have investment screening regulations [have tightened them](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/merkel-s-government-approves-tighter-rules-on-foreign-takeovers) and extended their scope in response to concerns that China, among others, could take controlling stakes in companies suddenly made vulnerable. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager suggested in a Financial Times interview that governments go further and buy stakes in companies themselves to stave off the threat of Chinese takeovers.\n\nMore far-reaching still are proposals to curb dependence on China, not just for [medical supplies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-06/virus-spurs-global-free-for-all-over-597-billion-medical-trade) but in areas such as battery technology for electric vehicles. EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan [said last week](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/hogan/announcements/introductory-statement-commissioner-phil-hogan-informal-meeting-eu-trade-ministers_en) there\u2019s a need for a discussion \u201con what it means to be strategically autonomous,\u201d including building \u201cresilient supply chains, based on diversification, acknowledging the simple fact that we will not be able to manufacture everything locally.\u201d Japan already earmarked $2.2 billion from its $1 trillion stimulus package to help its manufacturers [shift production away from China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/japan-to-fund-firms-to-shift-production-out-of-china).\n\nWithout mentioning China, EU trade ministers agreed in an April 16 call on the importance of diversifying to \u201creduce the reliance on individual countries of supply.\u201d As a first step, Berlin plans state funds and purchase guarantees to start industrial production of millions of surgical and face masks by late summer. China currently exports 25% of the world\u2019s face masks.\n\nWuttke of the EU trade chambers said the discussion on supply chains began when Beijing shut its ports earlier this year, prompting fears that pharmaceutical ingredients produced in China would not reach Europe, and causing policymakers to realize that strategic products had to be secured. According to another European official, even official suppliers were breaking contracts for items such as ventilators and scamming people, burning bridges along the way. \u201cPeople want to have their eggs in more baskets,\u201d said Wuttke.\n\n## Burning bridges\n\nCertainly, the tenor of the political debate in Europe has shifted since. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Bild newspaper that China\u2019s revising up of the death toll last week was \u201calarming,\u201d while French President Emmanuel Macron said in an FT interview there were \u201cclearly things that have happened that we don\u2019t know about.\u201d U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it can\u2019t be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with China once the pandemic is over.\n\nAs a result of the Covid-19 crisis, [pressure is growing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/johnson-s-huawei-plan-at-risk-as-u-k-set-to-rethink-china-ties) on the U.K. to reverse its decision to allow [Huawei Technologies](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0287771D:MK) a limited role in its fifth-generation mobile networks, while France may be less inclined to give Huawei a chunk of its 5G contracts after the embassy spat. Germany must make a decision by around midyear on Chinese involvement in its 5G networks.\n\nIn the battle of narratives, Germany is key, according to [Janka Oertel](https://www.ecfr.eu/%20profile/category/oertel_janka), director of the Asia program at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. As well as Europe\u2019s dominant economy, its trade ties to China dwarf those of its neighbors: German exports to China in 2019 were higher than the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands combined. It will assume the EU\u2019s rotating presidency on July 1, giving it the chance to turn the debate in Europe.\n\nChina could still win back favor and help secure a greater global role by acceding to demands to open up its markets and introduce a more level playing field for international business, said Oertel. \u201cThat would be something that the Europeans would very much appreciate,\u201d she said. All the same, she added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely.\u201d\n\n*\u2014 With assistance by Patrick Donahue*", "created_utc": 1587517643.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo550t8", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_g5rrya", "parent_id": "t1_fo55087", "score": 67, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo550t8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/g5rrya/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo550t8/"}
