Ice cream, Mandrake? Children's ice cream!...You know when fluoridation began?...1946. 1946, Mandrake. How does that coincide with your post-war Commie conspiracy, huh? It's incredibly obvious, isn't it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual, and certainly without any choice. That's the way your hard-core Commie works. I first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act of love... Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I \u2014 I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence. I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake. Women, er, women sense my power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women, Mandrake...but I do deny them my essence.\n\nMandrake, come over here, the Redcoats are coming!", "created_utc": 1586142625.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmk1zcj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmj2xza", "score": 59, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmk1zcj", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmk1zcj/"}
