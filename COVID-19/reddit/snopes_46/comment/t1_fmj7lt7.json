Just a few things I'd like to point out.. and ask.\n\n240 scientists is not the \"majority\"\n\nThose articles weren't very specific. What scientists? What are their fields?  How big of a study?\n\nSO many things can cause cancer, neuro and testicular damage. They could think they're correct, but simply had misleading studies.\n\ndo you understand the wide range of scientist you would need to really assess this?Neurologist, radiologist, molecular biologist, reproductive doctors and some sort of wireless Techs... ALL unbiased. That's No easy task. Especially in the face of Verizon, AT&T etc.\n\nI don't know what I think about this. I'm certainly open minded, but I don't have any studies in any of these fields. BUT if this were true, it'd be the largest conspiracy ever. What would 'they\" Gain from it? how do \"they\" protect themselves from the harmful 5g?\n\nWhat do you think the end play is, if 5g is really as bad as these articles say?", "created_utc": 1586124658.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj7lt7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmj3qg4", "score": 21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj7lt7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmj7lt7/"}
