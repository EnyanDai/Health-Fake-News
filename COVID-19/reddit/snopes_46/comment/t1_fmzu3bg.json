Ending 100% communist central government planning was liberal move. Just like it was to let people start their own bussinesses or to own private property. All those moves were liberalism in political sense because it meant more freedom in many aspects and decision making and those means were the stuff that brought in foreign investments. Just like hopes that those trends would continue and that all the rest of central planning that still exists in China will be let go at some point and economy will open even more. And it was gradually happening until around 2010 when China decided to go back before 1990s in all those aspects mentioned above.", "created_utc": 1586529561.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmzu3bg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fmzt58m", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmzu3bg", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fmzu3bg/"}
