Even if it just prevents you from unknowingly touching your mouth. All the other bs around it was because there was a shortage in masks in the west so the govt decided lying was a better option than telling the truth.\n\nIt strikes me that you're ignoring the other points I raised about this.\n\n>We weren't discussing what YouTube legally can do. We were discussing whether or not censorship was a good or bad idea. I never said YouTube broke the law. I brought the first amendment in to show how important free speech was deemed to have it literally be the first amendment written.\n\nThe government can do some things that people and companies are not allowed to do. People and companies can do some things that the government is not allowed to do. The first ammendment applies to the government, and to bring it up at all in the context of this conversation is misappropriated.\n\n>There is never a reason to take away certain fundamental rights, because then governments get too much of an opportunity to use shitty situations for their own gain. If anything, this pandemic has shown me how stupid everyone is capable of being. Including the politicians in charge now. I can just imagine Trump being able to censor whichever newsoutlets he deems as speaking lies during a pandemic.\n\nNow you're speaking about the government, why? They aren't taking away anyone's rights, are they?\n\n>You can't censor stupid.\n\nOn its face that's wrong since the article reports that that's exactly what they are doing. But more specifically, dumb ideas don't turn into national movements without a forum for their nonsense to be spread around. Conspiracy theories tend to crumble without an echo chamber of people agreeing with them. Youtube are making sure that their sit cannot be one.", "created_utc": 1586200067.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmm785m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmm5ost", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmm785m", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmm785m/"}
