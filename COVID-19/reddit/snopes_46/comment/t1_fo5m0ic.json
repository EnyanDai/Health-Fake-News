The reason why they continue to buy from China is because of quality, price, product, logistics; China dominates in nearly all of those except for quality which when there are millions of manufacturers you are going to get a range. This is why most of their purchasing is from China and not Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, elsewhere. This is not going to change that much or at all. A lot of the investment into factories in those other developing countries are from Chinese companies or China-funded local companies. Are you expecting European countries to fund and specialize in manufacturing locally or to fund those factories to replace the imported products from China? That would be expensive with incredibly high chance of business failure because you would compete directly against those Chinese companies. Therefore to make this viable as a business you would have to mandate some sort of purchasing requirement to only allow specific companies owned by EU to bid from, which sounds great in priciple but if they keep free-market principles and an open EU market then any competitor based in EU who can still import from Chinese companies would put you out of business; then all the money you invested into local or outsourced manufacturing would be lost. Who in their right mind is going to invest here?", "created_utc": 1587529011.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo5m0ic", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rr17", "parent_id": "t1_fo5l9et", "score": -26, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587529294.0, "name": "t1_fo5m0ic", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/g5rr17/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo5m0ic/"}
