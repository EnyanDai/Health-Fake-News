I designed high frequency signal sources for use in a CT diagnostic suite.  \n\nI was exposed to a huge number of radiologists, EM engineers, and several university radiology departments.  \n\nI worked at Livermore Labs for two years.  \n\nI am well informed in this field, and would turn your question back around on you.  \n\nIf you cannot understand the studies, why do you feel you can correctly interpret the results?\n\nAssuming you read the link to Scientific American where they distance themselves from the garbage post, you will see exactly what is wrong with the motley crew of papers he cites.  You\u2019d note that one of the papers he lists directly contradicts his theory.  \n\nI am published in roughly 20 journals, mostly in antenna design and novel methods of filtering unforeseen large interference in 24Ghz microwave data transmission.  \n\nI am literally an expert and I am saying the article you linked to is bunk.   Dozens of experts have said its bunk.
