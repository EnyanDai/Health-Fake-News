That said phenomena occurs is factual, how and why are theoretical and so models are created using facts/evidence gathered from observing/experimenting on said phenomena to explain how/why it occurs.\n\nIt is true that the theory can never be \"proven\" true, because there are always more discoveries to be made, which will either add to the theory or remove certain pieces, or reinforce it as it is - or, disprove it.\n\n\nBut scientists, after making observations, can create a list of criterion that, if observed to be true, would disprove the theory.\n\nA great example are the three criterion of falsifiability for Darwin's Theory of Evolution via Natural Selection;\n\n1 - if it were to be observed that parents do NOT pass traits onto offspring, evolutionary theory requires significant modification, or potentially, rejection\n\n2 - if it were observed that the environment is fully static and never-changing, this would partially disprove evolutionary theory are require modification or rejection\n\n3 - if it were observed that there is NOT more competition than enough food/resources to go around, this would require modification or rejection\n\nIf all three were observed, the Theory of Evolution would be toast.\n\nBut, any person (literally, anyone) can clearly see that these three criterion can not, nor will ever be observed, because their opposites are true. Ie parents DO pass traits down to offspring, etc.\n\nSo the Theory of Evolution cannot ever be disproven, as it passes its established criterion of falsifiability with flying colours. It has only received modification that added to it, as we got better at understanding it, and uncovered more of its secrets over the decades.", "created_utc": 1588890623.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptg49u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt5x1j", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptg49u", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptg49u/"}
