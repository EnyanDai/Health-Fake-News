And one isn\u2019t a rapist. Biden is not accuse rape. Whereas trump literally has raped. From ex wives to little fucking kids. Court documents put trump at a party with Epstein where a 13 year old girl claims trump raped her. On top of that the man is on camera bragging about sexual assaulting people. \n\nYeah Biden can be creepy but He isn\u2019t on tape saying he is creepy because he can move on them like a bitch and do as he wishes. So if you truly want people to vote with their conscience stop spreading misinforming. Biden is not accused of rape. He is accused of sexual assault. Which again is a really flimsy accusation. The man has already ran for VP and won. This news would have been leaked last election. Lastly the women herself has no one from the office at that time backing her up and her story has changed so much. These aren\u2019t issues trumps accuses faced. Trump accuses didn\u2019t suddenly have a weird love for Putin. Look at the women\u2019s twitter alleging Biden did this. She has been a liberal all the way up until 2017 then started posting a lot of shit about Putin and Russia. \n\nIf you vote with a conscience it\u2019s clearly who actually doesn\u2019t mind rape (as a party the right has shown rape is no big deal. Look at the Supreme Court.) lastly it\u2019s you vote for this country it\u2019s clear which person cares about this country and not selling it out. I wish you naive shits could read or have some basic critical thinking skills. We have so much evidence to show trump is working for hostile countries.", "created_utc": 1587260802.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnufd44", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntzg3p", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnufd44", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnufd44/"}
