It is possible that your reading, whilst containing the correct terminology on occasion, has contained very little information.\n\nIf you think that 5G is a conspiracy, this is quite a good indicator that you have only read sources that conform to your existing bias.  I will not claim to be an expert on this topic. I have a strong background in physics, but I've spent very little time on this 5G scare. What I can do is understand the papers I do read and I can do the maths. Whilst it is not absolutely certain that low intensity microwave radiation is entirely harmless or that we have the safety thresholds correctly set, it is very clear that we have less reason to suspect harm from lower frequency em due to the fact that it is not ionising and it is less penetrating. What that means, and what is absolutely supported by observation and theory, is that microwave em at the same intensity is less able to pass through the stratum lucidum (the dead layer of your skin) than even optical light.It is also less energetic. \n\nThe evidence is very strongly against your case that low intensity microwave em is harmful, although I will admit that we do have to consider thresholds. Now, if you were to stick your head against the mast emitters, you would experience significant and dangerous heating. But thanks to the inverse square law, just a little way away and the heating effect will be so small at the power levels we are talking about that you wouldn't even be able to measure it, it being significantly less than what you experience from optical light standing a comparable distance in front of car headlights, and far less penetrating.", "created_utc": 1586181229.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fml8mn6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmkuc8z", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fml8mn6", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fml8mn6/"}
