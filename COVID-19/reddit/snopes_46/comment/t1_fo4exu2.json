My mom believes this stuff even though she\u2019s so smart in other aspects. My theory? She\u2019s adopted and recently found a litter of half-siblings. They\u2019re all whack jobs. My mom has such a need for \u201cbelonging\u201d because she never had that, so she\u2019s casting her logic aside so she can have a connection with these people on some level. She\u2019s in denial. She also lives in an echo chamber (South Carolina) so it\u2019s rare if she\u2019s ever corrected. It\u2019s easy to reinforce any bullshit and cast doubts aside when you have equally insane people validating you.\n\nMy mom went through different weird phases while I was growing up. She was a \u201cwitch\u201d and did spells and shit during my pre-teens. Then she became a born again Christian when i was 16. She was this lonely bee visiting different flowers with no colony to belong to.\n\nPeople who believe this stuff also usually feel outcasted in other ways so they cling onto this group of \u201cmisunderstood misfits\u201d like it makes them better than the \u201csheeple\u201d they claim to resent, and it\u2019s those \u201csheeple\u201d that probably rejected them for other reasons.", "created_utc": 1587503191.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo4exu2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "parent_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587503391.0, "name": "t1_fo4exu2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskDocs/comments/g5fyvm/my_very_smart_dad_has_recently_started_reading/fo4exu2/"}
