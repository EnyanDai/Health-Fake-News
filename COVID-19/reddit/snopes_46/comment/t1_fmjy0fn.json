It's easy to look at this and say, \"yea! Ban misinformation! Look at the facts and science!\" But how many other things will they ban under the same precedent that might not be misinformation.\n\nHave people forgotten that corporations literally told pregnant women that cigarettes were less dangerous than stress so they should smoke while pregnant? This will be used for profit with no thought at all towards what is misinformation or truth in the future. Youtube could label anything misinformation they wanted, and I know people who would just buy it. Totally accept that it must be misinformation simply because Youtube removed it so that must make it official.\n\nI posted this same comment in regards to FB doing this to vaccines. Same thing applies and it should terrify us.\n\n\"Consensus by the scientific community.\"\n\nLook at the history of science. New ideas, TRUE ONES, that we currently accept as the truth were mocked and ridiculed by the scientific community initially.\n\n1930s. Continental drift. Ridiculed until the 60s.\n\n1840s. Handwashing before surgery saves lives. Ridiculed so badly the scientist was sent to an insane asylum and beat to death.\n\n1860s. Genetic Inheritance. Not accepted until the 1900s\n\nThere were scientists who proved with evidence a Helio centric solar system that lived THOUSANDS of years apart, lived and died, without the scientific community believing them.\n\nTo believe this is NOT happening today is to be willfully ignorant. We are not the first generations in history to suddenly stop this trend, as much as I'd like to believe it.", "created_utc": 1586140035.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmjy0fn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "score": -5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmjy0fn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmjy0fn/"}
