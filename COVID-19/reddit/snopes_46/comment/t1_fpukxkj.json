So whilst it was technically an invasion, it was very restrained and it's very understandable and I've no idea how anyone could have been surprised. \n\nMH17, right so did you read the investigation report? It said the likely culprit was separatists using a BUK SPAA system likely supplied by Russian forces. Russians would not have sent missiles up there whilst their President was in that airspace coming back from I believe it was South America. This fact gave some credence to the idea that it was Ukrainian forces attempting to take out the Russian President and fucked up but that's officially considered likely (the Russians believe it more likely though, publically). \n\nAs for their press freedoms yeah that's far from what Gorbachev envisioned for Russia and Putin is an incredibly effective control freak and not a fan of democracy but that's simply Putin and he is way better at playing this sanction game than NATO allies are giving him credit for based on their ever rising economy and middle class. Russia has had a very violent recent past though so the Russians do want someone who can secure them and their interest which Putin is good at doing, Ossetia, Azerbijan, Crimea these are all successes to that effect. Putin does not respond take my to attacks, he is very much a Nixon type.", "created_utc": 1588915654.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpukxkj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpuhpbt", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpukxkj", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpukxkj/"}
