Critical thinking is a useful skill in science but it is not entirely dependant on it.  \nReligions cant exist effectively if they try to counter evidence based facts so they move the goalposts or \"reinterpret\" as you call it.   \nIf people would actually critically think through the silly teachings of religion they would have to realize that its all BS and ancient myths with no foundation in reality, most people are not ready to abandon their comforting lies and wont.   \nReligion is and have allways been a bad thing, the evil it does and how it holds humanity back is not redeemed by its comfort to peoples death anxiety, thats an opinion. Some may argue that it is a good thing because it is a comfort to many and ignore the evil it brings.", "created_utc": 1586176738.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fml2c7v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmkvn4p", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fml2c7v", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fml2c7v/"}
