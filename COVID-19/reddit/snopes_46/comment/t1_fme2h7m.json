Like locusts, or that loud volume dead air speaker buzz. I'm in the Midwest, my friend I was discussing it with is in Cali experiencing the exact same thing lately, last few weeks. Both of us have started having sudden headaches and nausea, neck pain and stiffness, feeling of completely unprovoked anger and agitation out of nowhere. Like suddenly I am aware that I feel \"mad\" and I'm thinking WTF? It's completely random, I'm not an angry person and do not have a temper AT ALL. There's literally no trigger. It usually happens within the same hour or so of the headaches, buzzing noise, etc. My friend and I both are wondering if it's somehow related to 5g and all the changes in towers and power levels etc. Also if Earth frequencies and the earthquakes, meteor /comet activity, etc is adding to it all.. And, I get it that RFK, JR may be misleading as a setup with TPTB.. But that's not what my gut is telling me on this one. I remember reading years ago that I think Ted (?) Kennedy had died of a brain tumor and there was a lot of talk unofficially that the family believed it to be related to cell phone use.", "created_utc": 1585986628.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fme2h7m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuczaj", "parent_id": "t3_fuczaj", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fme2h7m", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fuczaj/robert_f_kennedy_jr_posted_this_regarding_5g_and/fme2h7m/"}
