It's a common belief among his peers his age, also from Serbia, because they're proud of what Tesla did but still are a bit superstitious.\n\nThis, however made him ripe for believing that 5g networks spread the actual Corona 19 virus. We've basically stopped talking to him because all he can talk about is that it's all a conspiracy and that the virus is a weapon, or that doctors are giving falsehoods to make money and hurt everyone else. All his peers of the same age have each other completely wound up on Mobdro and Facebook with conspiracy theories and misinformation, 10 or 15 old dudes clicking Facebook feed items which perpetuate their crazy ideas, and them talking about this shit all day.\n\nThe algorithms have really put these folks in a bad bad feedback loop.
