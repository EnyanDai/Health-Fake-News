Saying Google it is not anything. I understand what all of the top results are saying, and they are all interpretations of how that person feels the law should be enforced. It is no different than 100 different sites saying that a cop has to say he's a cop if you ask. The prevalence of the idea doesn't make it legal in any sense.\n\nThe only legal guidelines are these: \n\n1.)     if a site has any outward facing input from other persons than employees, then they enjoy the protections of section 230.\n\n2.)     Those protections allow them to delete anything they deem \"objectionable.\"\n\nThose are both pretty fucking vague.\n\nIf the Stratton Oakmont case had been the end of things, then we could have a real discussion about whether YouTibe should be considered a publisher or a platform. \n\nIt wasn't, though. The Communications Decency Act was passed and it absolved online services from liability for both the content they host and the moderation they provide. The dichotomy you are trying to present (publisher vs platform) was solved with section 230 and that solution is the opposite of what you originally said. \n\nYouTube does not have to worry about liability for the videos its hosts. It can also moderate the content that it hosts.\n\nThere is no discrepancy here concerning section 230. All of the internet stuff you read about it is akin to those discussions about entrapment I keep using as an example.", "created_utc": 1586207140.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmmkwai", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fw0hr2", "parent_id": "t1_fmmgqvk", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmmkwai", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fw0hr2/youtube_is_censoring_all_videos_related_to/fmmkwai/"}
