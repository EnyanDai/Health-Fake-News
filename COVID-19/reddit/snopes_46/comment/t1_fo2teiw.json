Each individual photon carries enough energy to raise an electron into a higher energy state, as it decays to the lower energy state it emits an infra-red photon, heating its neighbours. \n\nConductive heating, as seen in ovens and pans, happens gradually, where the molecules all heat up together. The difference with a microwave is that whichever molecule absorbs the microwave photon is heated way hotter than its surroundings often causing the molecule to denature, which then heats its neighbouring molecules by conduction. \nMicrowaves cause proteins to denature even at low temperatures, whereas to denature proteins by conduction, you have to heat up the whole pan to the denaturing temperature.\n\nA skin will form on milk in the microwave before it boils because some of the proteins have denatured, whereas milk on a hob wont form a skin until the whole pan boils.\n\nDenaturing a protein doesn't even necessarily cause heating if you supply just enough energy to break a bond. a good analogy is that it takes energy to turn 0C ice into 0C water, you didn't heat it, but you changed its state.", "created_utc": 1587473619.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo2teiw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuh83m", "parent_id": "t1_fme6xqb", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo2teiw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fuh83m/telecoms_engineers_are_facing_verbal_and_physical/fo2teiw/"}
