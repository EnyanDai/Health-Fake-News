Skin is the reason Alpha radiation doesn\u2019t cause nasty genetic mayhem. If we inhale a dust that is alpha radioactive, the effects are nasty, but it won\u2019t pass through our skin.\n\nYou're telling me there is \"no links\", but you're also telling me no studies have been done with a good analog for skin?\n\nDon't claim there is \"NO LINKS\" because the info hasn't been studied. It's precisely because there are a lack of studies that I am posting other links to cellular damage. The whole point of my post is to bring awareness that 5G does effect us in some ways. MAYBE not all cells, but we don't know yet. To propose 5G is \"completely safe\" like most people are, only because of a lack of studies, is preposterous. WE NEED THOSE STUDIES TO BE DONE. And they should have been done BEFORE THE ROLLOUT of the technology.\n\nNothing of your post or the previous poster's statements has refuted any risks of  5G with actual data or studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Nevertheless, I can point you at hundreds of papers on how Alpha radiation triggers genetic mutation. In a Petrie dish. (Or when inhaled, but we don\u2019t inhale 5G masts) The papers are telling the truth, but count on the reader to be able to understand the conditions of the experiment and not irresponsibly draw conclusions that ignore reality.\n\nThere is a also a bit of fun irony in your statement of not inhaling 5G, considering oxygen absorbs the 60GHz band (one of the frequencies contained in 5G) entirely, so we actually are inhaling 5G", "created_utc": 1586968120.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnhsl3t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnhr5ca", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586968383.0, "name": "t1_fnhsl3t", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnhsl3t/"}
