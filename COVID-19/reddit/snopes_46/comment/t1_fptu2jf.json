But rather cell tower destruction being covered by domestic terrorism laws. Which it should.\n\n\n>I have not argued against that. Strawman.\n\nNot what a strawman is an is absolutely in line with your base argument.\n\n>Cell infrastructure has a lot of redundancies typically. Rarely is an individual only capable of connecting to a single tower, particularly for 911 calls which allow you to use any carrier's tower not just your own. In some extremely rural cases I suppose this could be a concern, but I would not generalize a massive expansion of domestic terrorism laws over a few exceptional cases.\n\nThey are attacking \"multiple towers\" that redundancy falls fairly fast as this 5G scare nonsense spreads. So that entire point is moot. Making the assumption just few towers would be effected. Even though the people willing to do this shit dont move around but not likely target more.\n\n>Otherwise you just have ugly egotistical insults to provide to the conversation.\n\nRight and your \"boo hoo big gubment\" argument is supposed to be worth a damn? Get tf out of here. Expanding terrorism laws to include disruption of communication equipment is not only the right thing to do, it's the logical thing to do. \n\nThe only \"right\" you would lose is your \"right\" to fuck with people and disrupt communications. Slippery slope is an actual logical fallacy and you are defending nonsense. What a hill to die on. Make me wonder if you are one of those same nuts spooked outta their gourd that 5G is going to spontaneously synthesize covid in your blood.", "created_utc": 1588898276.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptu2jf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptswiz", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptu2jf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptu2jf/"}
