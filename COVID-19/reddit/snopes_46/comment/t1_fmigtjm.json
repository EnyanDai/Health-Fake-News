Did you conveniently ignore the sentence that said \"...  **but the results add evidence to the idea that RF radiation might potentially impact human health** \" because it also looks like you ignored that. If you actually read the study instead of going to a website like \"the verge\" to get a summary you would see they did see correlation but were unable to determine specifically how.\n\nSo if there was a correlation between a frequencies as low as the ones with 2G and 3G networks, what would you think would happen in a 5G network with 5G even being 100 TIMES more powerful than a 4G network which is already more powerful than 2G and 3G. \n\n> only beginning into statistical significance in one sex. \n\nSo your logic is that if there are correlations only affecting one sex than it doesnt mean anything...thats foolish.\n\n> radiotionhealthrisks.coms  studies are hosted on their own site because most have been removed from the original scientific journals they were in, \n\nSMH yea I can really tell you didnt actually do your due diligence and go to the links. Show me proof that most of the links have been removed. Also, so you conveniently ignore the links that are still in their scientific journals.
