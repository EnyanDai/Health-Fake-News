First off 5g is a different technology than 4g, even the effects of 4g were improperly studied in terms of long term health effects. Is the first pools of thought.\n\nAnd the second is poeple thinking it causes coronovirus, or its a huge conspiracy of mind control. The second set is sadly the one gaining more traction. \n\nThis leads me to believe this is a dissemination campaign to forgo the proper testing on the technology. I do not think 5g cause covid, but with the massive increase in general health concerns from autism to cancer. We the people need to demand proper testing on new technology, from vaccines to 5g. We need to stop playing into the hands of corporations and start making them responsible for there actions. \n\nI personally do not see a need for 5g. I am wondering if other people do? Do you feel like your mobile network bogs you down constantly, To the point we need to increase bandwidth to such extreme measures? This push for 5g makes me think there are ulterior motives whether it be just money, or it is really about mass data collection and populace control. At the end of the day without third party studies deeming this technology safe why would we allow this to permeate are lives?", "created_utc": 1587221480.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsh3de", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1xy5w", "parent_id": "t3_g1xy5w", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnsh3de", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/g1xy5w/over_50_cell_towers_vandalized_in_uk_due_to_5g/fnsh3de/"}
