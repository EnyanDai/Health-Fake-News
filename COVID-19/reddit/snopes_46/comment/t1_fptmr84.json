You honestly expect everyone to go look at everything you said all over a thread on different comment chains? That's ridiculous. \n\nAlso, there is easily accessible and easy to understand information and studies on lots of topics that appear on that subreddit. I've tried and I'm sure many others have tried linking those graphics and studies to people on that sub. I was met with accusations of being a liar and that I was a government shill or a corporate shill. You can give people all the information in the world. Doesn't mean they are going to listen to it. I had the same discussion on Twitter today. Sometimes people just aren't worth the time and frustration to help. Why am I going to provide research and data to someone who is only going to call it fake because it goes against what they have set in their mind? I have a full time job and it is not trying to convince grown adults to use the information that is right in front of their face. \n\nThat being said, you're just a bitch man. Like seriously you jumped into a thread and started talking shit to some random guy for thinking that some of the people on a sub are stupid.
