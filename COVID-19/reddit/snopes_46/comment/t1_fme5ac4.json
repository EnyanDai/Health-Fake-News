It's some sort of deep psychological problem. It's always a very similar story with these guys. They didn't succeed in school, they didn't allow themselves to succeed in school and at some point convinced themselves that what they were learning in school wasn't real or correct. It comes down to their own problems. They recognised that they were being graded at a certain level in school and their egos couldn't accept that that was \"their level\" so they learned to blame the system eventually and then once they stop trusting what they are being taught within the system they start to believe every conspiracies that those within the system seem to hate.\n\nIts not something you are going to fix by throwing money at public education. These people aren't special needs, they have half a brain. But they can't accept that they have a half a brain.\n\nThe problem has always been there but it has become exacerbated by the existant of social media, and in particular Facebook and YouTube. Now they can all get together.", "created_utc": 1585989941.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fme5ac4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fulctt", "parent_id": "t1_fmdydqm", "score": 30, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fme5ac4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/fulctt/broadband_engineers_threatened_due_to_5g/fme5ac4/"}
