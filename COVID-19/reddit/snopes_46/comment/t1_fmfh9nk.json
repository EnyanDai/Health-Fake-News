Brighter objects of the same color/frequency just deliver more photons, not higher energy ones.\n\nOnce you have a single photon with high enough energy it can knock electrons off their host atom, called ionization. That can screw with DNA and cause damage to flesh and cause cancer.\n\nUV is just barely into the ionization range at the low end, and up from there are X-rays and Gamma rays. Visible light is below UV, then below that is microwaves then radio waves.\n\nDigital signals like 3G, 4G, and 5G as well as 5GHz wifi and some RC transmitters are in microwave band (way, waaaay too low frequency to ionize), which still freaks some people out that wifi will slowly cook you, except the microwaves in your kitchen appliance are ~700-1000 watts in an enclosed box to further concentrate them. Home wifi works at ~1 watt and spreads then in every direction. Basically the heat and damage difference between touching a theatrical spotlight vs a small LED.", "created_utc": 1586027212.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmfh9nk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuf6yk", "parent_id": "t1_fmdjap6", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_5r98w", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmfh9nk", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/FuckYouKaren/comments/fuf6yk/karen_has_a_go_at_workers_installing_5g_because/fmfh9nk/"}
