And because they likely will use their China built tech to farm data. \n\nBut since you seem to think China wants to use 5G to kill everyone, Ill take a moment to explain something: \n\nNo government, especially a slave driving, totalitarian one like China, wants to kill its people. People are why they have power and money. China wants to be rich and everything they do is for money and control. \n\nOccam's Razor is a proven problem solving technique that rings true 99% of the time. \"The simplest answer is often the correct one\". If you have to jump through hoops to justify your argument when the obvious argument is sound and reasonable, then you're wrong. \n\nSo no. China isn't attacking the world with 5g. They just want money and power. \n\nGoogle 5g, its no different than any of the other billions of radio waves bouncing around already, and in fact if you have a wireless router in your house or your neighbors houses and its less than 6 years old, then you've been living with 5G anyway. EDIT: scratch that last part, 5G is not the same as 5Ghz wifi.
