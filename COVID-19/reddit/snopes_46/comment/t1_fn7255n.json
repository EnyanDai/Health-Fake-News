This is a late response but I searched up David Icke after my conspiracy theorist cousin sent me this video. Wanted to see what people think about it. I might watch it in a bit but I'm just getting more and more irritated when she says \"Coronavirus is caused by panic.\" Alright buddy. She gets all of her news from instagram and sent me something like \"pH greater than 7 will kill coronavirus\" and then for some reason lemon was on there and with my knowledge, I'm pretttyyyyy sure lemon is acidic. I just can't.\n\n\nI struggle SO hard to talk to people when I dislike them/do not respect them. It's just so clear on my face. How do you do it??? Ahahah\n\n\nAnd yes, she is also a flat earther and an antivaxxer. I don't know why. She's tried having conversations with us about it and we always come up with rebuttals but you can't change someone who's beliefs are this deep.", "created_utc": 1586711825.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn7255n", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwkcwo", "parent_id": "t1_fmq94ea", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn7255n", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwkcwo/youtube_tightens_rules_after_david_icke_5g/fn7255n/"}
