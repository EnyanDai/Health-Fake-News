When a statement is true then repeating it only does good. When a statement is false then having it freely expressed and refuted allows the falsehood to be clearly identified. In cases where a statement is partly true and partly false the open discussion allows the truth to be brought into focus.\n\nThe problem though is most people don't have the time to dedicate to academic study of any particular topic, so they apply a heuristic of \"do I trust this source or not\" where trust is a sliding scale. Even in situations where trust isn't high the moment a statement enters the recipient's mind it is more likely to be recalled later as a \"fact\" simply because it is there unless it is easily refuted.\n\nThis is why techniques like the Gish Gallop are so effective on so many people, because they overwhelm you with statements that enter your mind without you having a chance to rationally think about each one critically.", "created_utc": 1586120332.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmj0269", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmi56gd", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmj0269", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmj0269/"}
