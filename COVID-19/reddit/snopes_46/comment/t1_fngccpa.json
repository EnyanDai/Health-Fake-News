There\u2019s no such thing as a conspiracy theorist, and someday soon we should come together and have a world view that is on the same page. The problem right now is some people actually look into stories like Jeffrey Epstein, building 7, Tic tac ufo incident, and then some people that don\u2019t care enough to. \n\nOnce you look into those things you realize the \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d were actually right about certain stories. \u201cPizzagate\u201d is about a cia blackmail program involving pedophilia. We have proof the government covered up building 7 coming down on 9/11. Since we have proof of those things, you people should realize that calling people \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d is a propaganda tactic used against anyone that questions certain narratives.\n\nBut nope, you people are too proud to admit when you\u2019re wrong. So you continue to do the CIAs work for them, while they use our taxes to bomb brown people and fuck children. Bill gates is tight with Jeffrey Epstein and you all are letting him in charge of the most important human event in years without any question of his motives. Your arrogance and pride will let \u201cthem\u201d run us off a cliff.", "created_utc": 1586927990.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngccpa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngbcrr", "score": -34, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngccpa", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngccpa/"}
