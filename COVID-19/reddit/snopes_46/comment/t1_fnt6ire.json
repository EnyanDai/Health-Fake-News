We still make rash emotional decisions to stress we don\u2019t understand and choose to believe things however unlikely they sound in times of crisis.\n\nWhen we go through the history books and mock how we reacted to the bubonic plague, how our ancestors made human sacrifices to appease deities, and in more recent history how insane a whole country could be to follow a mad man on genocidal crusade into a world war. This. This is what we do. The only difference is how convincing the crazy person was to other people. Imagine if they were a great orator with a large social media following. We will keep fucking up. But you know, do your best to politely remind your other humans \u201chey..... you\u2019re being pretty fucking crazy. Don\u2019t do that please.
