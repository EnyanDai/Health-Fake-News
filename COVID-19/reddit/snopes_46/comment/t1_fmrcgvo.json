And rapidly increasing *(yes even with covid 19 we are still increasing every minute)\n\nSurely you are fine with your 4g connection. But big corp wants to provide everyone with higher data, meaning the whole big group of us will need more bandwidth and a higher data rate so people can get used to being able to play higher quality video games and watch best quality hd videos and share info on the device in their hands. They want a nintendo switch type device that can go anywhere and millions of teens can walk around like zombies playing call of dooty on the next generation handheld device at a rate equal to or better than current ps4 on cable ethernet. You may not feel like you \"need it\" today but they suck us in slowly and one day you try to go back to podunct town with 2g or 4g available you will cry at how slow it is.\n\nAnd why? So big corp can maximize profits and big cable provider can maximize their ability to rape the service providers*(like uber and lyft for example - they can give more or less bandwidth to whichever company pays the highest percent of their profits to the provider....if the isp throttles down the users ability to access the app the company gets less customers and the other one makes more profits.) \n\nIts all a big money grab and big corp just wants to grab more money. It doesn't even really affect you now. But if everyone else gets 5g and you stay on 4g......the whole internet will upgrade to better quality everything and you will be stuck on your 4g and your download speeds will be crap because the amount of data you are trying to download will exceed what you currently can get......then you will feel obligated to move to 5g.", "created_utc": 1586319313.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmrcgvo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwvf0s", "parent_id": "t1_fmr66wb", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmrcgvo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fwvf0s/if_184_countries_have_coronavirus_and_only_five/fmrcgvo/"}
