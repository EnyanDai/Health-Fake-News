It's terribly unpleasant, and it's very difficult to prove that anybody was at fault,'' he said.\n\n>Professor Isaacs said although it was hard to estimate the number of children in Australia who might use such a scheme, about one child in every million who received the measles vaccine was expected to get encephalitis, which can cause permanent brain damage. Such a case would warrant compensation, he said.\n\n>''Because we give it to about 250,000 children a year, you can expect to see one case in Australia every four years and it would occur about two weeks after the vaccine,'' he said.\n\n>The statistic should not put parents off vaccination, he said, because the risk of getting encephalitis in a child who is not immunised and gets the measles is about one in 1000.\n\n\nThe above commenter is correct. All vaccines are an interplay between accepted risk. It's that the risk presented by the vast majority of widely-used vaccines far outweighs the risk from the diseases they prevent.\n\nI have no idea where you've gotten the idea that the medical industry can do nothing harmful or that the government (the Australian government? Western governments?) will not permit any amount of risk whatsoever, but it's strongly misguided. That kind of blind belief in the face of evidence is not dissimilar to that which ardent anti-vaxxers have.", "created_utc": 1586931422.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnggew2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1gtim", "parent_id": "t1_fngfont", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586933069.0, "name": "t1_fnggew2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/australia/comments/g1gtim/5g_and_antivax_conspiracy_theorists_are/fnggew2/"}
