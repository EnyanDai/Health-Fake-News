He is so deep in sleep that he tries to convince you that there are no flames and  you are part of his dream when you are shaking him.\n\nThen you move to the next bedroom and experience the same thing.\n\nThe only logical response is for you to get out of the burning house and leave them to their fate, but you cant because you are locked in there with them.\n\nYou can resolve yourself to at least  knowing the truth before you die rather than lying in an ignorant slumber, like the fools around you....but even death provides little escape.\n\nFor the very ignorance we face here is the same rot that condemns conscious awareness on all levels of existence.... it is only in matters of degree...\n\nAim for the purest clearest light...but dont doubt the underlying corruption in this realm is infused with the very flames that drew us back here like moths, lifetime after lifetime.\n\nThe fire is warm and comforting. It is life giving to sit close to.\n\nThe problem is it's also far too easy to become, so much so we are indistinguishable from it...\n\n\nRead into this what you will.\n\nPeace.", "created_utc": 1586238726.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmny1xr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fw14l5", "parent_id": "t1_fmmr59y", "score": -3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2f3oes", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586239012.0, "name": "t1_fmny1xr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fw14l5/at_least_20_uk_phone_masts_vandalised_over_false/fmny1xr/"}
