Or, are they simply looking for anyone with a Ph.D. behind their name to sign as to look more legitimate?  \n\n> Have you seen the former president of Microsoft Canada say 5G is potentially dangerous?  \n\nOh, you mean Frank Clegg, the businessman with a BA in IT? Right, I'm sure he's well qualified in cellular biology and physics. He's also the same guy that is fighting to claim that WiFi is dangerous, something that has been proven false *ad nauseum*.  \n\nThis is what I mean. The argument against 5G is built on a whole ton of questionable figures. The science says nothing more than \"5G effects things, we can't exactly tell you what or to what extent this would have on humans, but if we keep looking, we'll find it\". These limited studies, most of which result in a conclusion being \"more studies are needed\", have yet to prove negative health effects. I'd like to challenge you to find a single reputable study done that proves negative health effects. In fact, the two most reputable studies done to my knowledge that would have any relevance to human health is [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215526798_Effects_of_Millimeter_Waves_Radiation_on_Cell_Membrane_-_A_Brief_Review) one and [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45662-6#ref-CR36) which both relate to membrane permeability when exposed to MMW EMR. Both of these studies finish with \"more science is needed\" but no one seems to produce this science that is so crucial to rationally outlaw 5G networks. Let me remind you that the burden of proof is not to prove something doesn't exist, it's to prove something exists. \n\nBased on your suggestion that 5G causes cancer, you clearly have a very limited understanding of the studies that have been done including the study on rats that I facetiously referenced.", "created_utc": 1586293167.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmq5d32", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmpxx6s", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmq5d32", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmq5d32/"}
