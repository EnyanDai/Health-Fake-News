Is that coronavirus is distributed via 5G. Or \"remotely activated\" via it. Or, ugh, I dunno.\n\nI have one of these nutters in my friend circle (although since I learnt he was one of these nutters, I now distance myself from him, in case I get what he's got).\n\nHere's an excerpt from the conversation I had last night with him (P, below), prompted by me sending him a link to the article. \n\nHis rationale is \"they lied about x, therefore they are undoubtedly lying about y\" \n\nAnd yes, he's a flat earther, and yes, he's antivax, and yes, he's actually quite an intelligent person. \n\n--\n\n[03/04, 20:56] P: Why did Brussels decide not to have 5g. Why are various cities saying no. Tabacco is known to kill. Yet the government let's you smoke because needs the tax. No difference here.\n\n[03/04, 20:58] Me: 1. People should not be attacked for doing their job, regardless of the job, but especially when it's lawful employment at a phone company!\n\n2. Show me one credible bit of truth that 5G is harmful, let alone that it is linked to a biological virus\n\n[03/04, 20:59] Me: It's wrong, and spreading lies and baseless conspiracy theories is _actually_ resulting in people being directly harmed and lives put at risk due to damaged infrastructure\n\n[03/04, 21:00] P: Same as the diesel scandal.. With porsche and vw. Same people who organise the reports are the ones that sells the products. Never said its OK to hurt people doing their job.\n\n[03/04, 21:00] P: Not spreading conspiracy just looking at what the news doesn't tell you.\n\n[03/04, 21:02] Me: Brussels banned 5G due to \"health concerns\" and that'll be because there's someone on the board that believes this horse shit.\n\n[03/04, 21:03] Me: Or because they have very stringent radiation standards, stricter than the rest of the world, and that 5G cannot operate properly within it\n\n[03/04, 21:03] P: Whatever\n\n[03/04, 21:03] Me: But it certainly won't be due to the fact that someone's found something that actually points to a genuine health concern!\n\n[03/04, 21:04] P: Oh. So strict radioactive waves tested on the brains of soldiers as per the first tests who had thicker skulls is acceptable to all of us. That's sealed then. Its bound to be healthy\n\n[03/04, 21:04] P: Said that about smoking\n\n[03/04, 21:04] P: Said that about cement\n\n[03/04, 21:04] P: Said that about thermidamite\n\n[03/04, 21:05] P: List goes on. Nothing to see here.\n\n[03/04, 21:05] P: Government never lies.", "created_utc": 1585997663.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmebknn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_furdeu", "parent_id": "t1_fmeakce", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmebknn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/furdeu/masts_set_on_fire_over_false_5g_coronavirus_claims/fmebknn/"}
