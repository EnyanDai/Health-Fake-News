Even if it just prevents you from unknowingly touching your mouth. All the other bs around it was because there was a shortage in masks in the west so the govt decided lying was a better option than telling the truth.\n\n\n\n>The first ammendment is irrelevant here because Youtube is a private company and not a government.\n\nWe weren't discussing what YouTube legally can do. We were discussing whether or not censorship was a good or bad idea. I never said YouTube broke the law. I brought the first amendment in to show how important free speech was deemed to have it literally be the first amendment written.\n\n>Not when there's a global pandemic going on, there isn't. \n\nThere is never a reason to take away certain fundamental rights, because then governments get too much of an opportunity to use shitty situations for their own gain. If anything, this pandemic has shown me how stupid everyone is capable of being. Including the politicians in charge now. I can just imagine Trump being able to censor whichever newsoutlets he deems as speaking lies during a pandemic.\n\n>Misleading people about the cause of the virus will make people ignore the rules put in place to limit the impact of the virus, causing people to die.\n\nNo, stupid people will do whatever they want regardless of what their excuse is. Whether it's because 5G has something to do with corona or because the priest blew away corona so we're safe. You can't censor stupid. Starting censorship anywhere will just be a bad precedent for allowing more. That's the way taking away rights works.", "created_utc": 1586199258.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmm5ost", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmm4dd2", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586199450.0, "name": "t1_fmm5ost", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmm5ost/"}
