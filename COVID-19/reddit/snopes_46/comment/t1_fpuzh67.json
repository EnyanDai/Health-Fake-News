Their much smaller neighbours were very rapidly evolving both the airplane and the ship into machines of war, while at the same time drafting and arming civilians. Oh, anyone could see this would work wonders on the massive, starving and empoverished mother Russia.\n\nSo under the beatiful moto of \"World Peace\" the Czar called for leaders of the World to travel to Hague in 1907 and basically Said:\n\n\"You see dudes. This war business is getting really dangerous and really expensive, real fast. What if we promise to halt weapons development for... Lets say... 5 years, and then meet again?\"\n\nAnd the World was like:\n\n\"Hmm, let me think about that for a bit.... Yeah, no... not going to happen. We can go play Polo though if you fancy it.\"\n\nHistory repeats itself. Russian military sucesses in the last 500 years aren't directly related with being a millitary and techonology powerhouse. It can be summarized on a single thing that they have, that none of their western neighbours have. SIZE!\n\nNapoleon was beatten fighting the sheer SIZE of the Russian scorched terrain. The Germans were starved and Frozen in both WW by the \"SIZE\" of their Winters. And the Red army got to Berlin first by the SIZE of their numbers.", "created_utc": 1588929321.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpuzh67", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptsd9n", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1588929533.0, "name": "t1_fpuzh67", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpuzh67/"}
