{"author": {}, "body": "The other day my mom asked me to fact check some bullshit conspiracy meme that her friend posted. It was about how the president of Tanzania \"woke up\" when coronavirus test kits showed positive results on samples of like a fruit I think - but he tested them on fruit to see if they were fake tests, and it proved that they were faulty tests when they came back positive. It didn't prove that there's a global plot run by Bill Gates to create a fake virus and vaccinate and track us. \n\nFunny thing is her friend is morbidly obese I think, and so are her kids, so the fact that she believes it's a fake government conspiracy is extremely dangerous for her. This doesn't mean anything to them though when they get to spread their crazy to everyone else who thinks like them. \n\nLink to the article I found in 3 seconds to disprove her friend:  [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/tanzania-president-questions-coronavirus-kits-animal-test-200503174100809.html](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/tanzania-president-questions-coronavirus-kits-animal-test-200503174100809.html)", "created_utc": 1588897601.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptswb2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt9h48", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptswb2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptswb2/"}
