Not many people make the relation between radio transmissions and radiation, but i could see them assuming a new technology like 5G seems more powerful and assume these seemingly spaceage radio waves can cause mutations. Then they stop digging once they found what they want to be outraged about, ignoring that the actual effects of radiation poisining, which is more along the lines of cancer. Mutating cellularly(no pun intended) instead of outwardly(whole separate organism). Then they'd have to assume it's outwardly mutating SARS/Corona/Covid/what the hell we're calling this, into a super virus? \n\nI know i'm not breaking this down properly with decently researched scientific evidence. This flawed, hastily cobbled together, string of empathetic reasoning still can't explain why something like 5G and Corona virus are being linked...not sufficiently anyway.\nI'm dumb enough to string this all together so dangerously wrong, amd I'm still under the correct belief that 5G cellular transmission has nothing to do with this pandemic.", "created_utc": 1586726890.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn7srpk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g02rg2", "parent_id": "t3_g02rg2", "score": 42, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh11", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn7srpk", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/offbeat/comments/g02rg2/celebs_share_rumors_linking_5g_to_coronavirus/fn7srpk/"}
