PR? Misinformation? What do they call it these days?\n\nSince you're such a self-proclaimed expert, then answer these:\n\n1. \nWhat 5G biological safety studies are there to support your claim that **high 5G cell density and gigahertz RF exposure around the entire globe 24/7** is safe for humans/humanity?\n\n2.\nCan you name any **scientists that say we need more 5G health and safety studies** who (according to you) \"dont understand basic physics\"? What specifically don't they understand?\n\n3.\nAs more scientists investigate the question of 5G health and safety, and as the publc becomes more aware of the issue, they will understand the need to halt the \"5G profit rollout madness rush\" and switch to doing **extensive and broad-scale 5G health and safety studies** instead. \n\n4.\nMany scientists, with even better credentials than yours, agree with this line of thinking... (Question is: are you stupid enough to think that it's because of a basic misunderstanding physics? lol).\n\n\n*    https://www.5gspaceappeal.org/the-appeal   (scroll down for references to studies)\n\n*    http://www.5gappeal.eu/\n\n*    [Dr. Devra Davis on health risks of 5G @ UC San Francisco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmp_OTT05Tw)\n\n*    [Dr. Martin Pall, prof emeritus at Washington State on the deployment of 5G without sufficient research on the biological risks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjt0iJThPU0 (full lecture))\n\n*   [The International EMF Scientist Appeal, which calls for stronger exposure limits](https://emfscientist.org/index.php/emf-scientist-appeal)\n\n5.\nSorry to burst your ego, but you're not the only person with a rational and coherent argument on the issue of 5G health and safety debate.\n\n6.\nIf you're so confident in your position on 5G, then why don't we get you on Joe Rogan with a scientist who says we need more studies? Can you walk the talk?
