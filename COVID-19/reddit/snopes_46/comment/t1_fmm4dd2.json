It didn't change based on where we were.\n\nThe point is that masks give people a false sense of security, potentially having people ignore social distancing rules. There's a huge potential of infecting yourself if you don't know how to use them properly (it invites touching your face with your hands to adjust and remove). And only specific *kinds* of masks work and only when properly fitted.\n\nSo yes, they *can* make things worse.\n\n\n> But the point is that you don't get to decide where the line is between what can be said and what can't. There is a reason free speech is the first amendment, even if people get to spout bullshit.\n\n*I* don't get to decide, but Youtube can if they choose to. The first ammendment is irrelevant here because Youtube is a private company and not a government. The first ammendment regards the *government* not being allowed to censor people.\n\nWhy is it that I'm not American, yet I understand the 1st ammendment better than you do?\n\n>The costs far outweigh the pros of censoring people\n\nNot when there's a global pandemic going on, there isn't. Misleading people about the cause of the virus will make people ignore the rules put in place to limit the impact of the virus, causing people to die.", "created_utc": 1586198564.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmm4dd2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmlf5j4", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmm4dd2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmm4dd2/"}
