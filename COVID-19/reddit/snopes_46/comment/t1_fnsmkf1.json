I personally do not agree with this, but in the spirit of sharing info and hopefully answer your question, it\u2019s worth pointing out where most of the nonsense has come from. I\u2019ve been following all the fringe stuff, since I have lots of time on my hands. Some of the allegations being spouted are hard to read, and it\u2019s heartbreaking to see so many people taken in by it. \n\nHowever, typically, the media have misconstrued the 5g conspiracy theory to the extent that it is now a completely new one. The original charge was never that 5g causes coronavirus. \n\nThe original charge seemed to be a combination of two assertions:\n\n1) there is no new corona virus or covid19. What they are testing for (and applying positive covid19 results a to) is not covid 19, it is simply cell matter called exosomes which are produced by the body whilst the body is stressed in some way. There has not yet been a \u2018gold standard\u2019 isolation of covid19 to test against, therefore any testing that shows positive for covid 19 must be testing for something else (i.e. exosomes).\n\n[This ](https://youtu.be/Xr8Dy5mnYx8) is the video I watched. Not given any extra credibility by one of the participants having a chemtrails poster in the background.....\n\n2) 5g somehow causes all kinds of reactions to certain people, and since 5g is being rolled out at the moment, It is the effects of 5g making people ill and covid 19 is just a cover for the dastardly effects of 5g. \n\nThe 5g element doesn\u2019t make sense on so many levels. If it were true, you would expect huge clusters of ill people around 5g cell locations, which seems easily provable and clearly has not been.  I would also imagine that more generally, telecoms companies don\u2019t tend to want their customers dead.", "created_utc": 1587224674.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsmkf1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnsi9qt", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnsmkf1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnsmkf1/"}
