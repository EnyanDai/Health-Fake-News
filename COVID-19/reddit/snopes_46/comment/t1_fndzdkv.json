When I say independent research, and transparency in the technology behind 5g, etc. I meant for EVERYONE, I dont think I can be more clear to you. I want to be able to search it on google myself, right now, and pull up ANY information I want to, to my hearts content. I want to know what size capacitors they used, what wattage the lights are, I want to know if the solder is lead free, I want to know if they used philips or flathead screws. I want to know every type model transmitter they make, and what differs between the models and WHY they differ.  I want to come out of the experience with a full knowledge of the technology behind the electronics in a 5g transmitter. I want to be able to take that information, download it, send it to my buddy who is an electronic engineer to explain a part I dont understand if I had a electrical engineer friend. I want it ALL, I want THE SPECS. and we ALL deserve that information if we want it, WHENEVER we want it. especially  if we are going to be FORCED to live under the technology with no means of escaping it.   do you understand what I am ACTUALLY trying to say now?", "created_utc": 1586880300.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fndzdkv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g0rx6e", "parent_id": "t1_fndwr2g", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586882794.0, "name": "t1_fndzdkv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/g0rx6e/5g_tower_fire_in_italy_during_coronavirus_lockdown/fndzdkv/"}
