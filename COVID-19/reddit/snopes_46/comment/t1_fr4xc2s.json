My HF prof was chairing it and they had an microbiologist and physicist on the panel. They talked complete sense and broke down exactly where the lines we draw for EM safety are and the research that has gone into deciding these things and the years and years of research that shows that what they're saying is scientifically impossible. Didn't matter. The commenters called them shills and that they're the wrong people to be speaking about it and started quoting papers which they thought backed their stance. Personally I was thinking that if this worked we could then replicate it with universities world wide where we allow people to voice their concerns and educate them about the actual science. Problem is, it's not a hard science problem, it's entirely psychological. Not to say that they're crazy but that they're worldview has been so warped that the science doesn't matter.", "created_utc": 1589898652.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr4xc2s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr3xe5x", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr4xc2s", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr4xc2s/"}
