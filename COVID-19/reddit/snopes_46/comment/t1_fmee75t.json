Has a small construction business, has his own plane, nice house etc. I thought he was a bit dim when he started posting about Brexit and shit all over Facebook last year, but he told me he wants to vote for the Tories because it's better for the business, and I can't really blame him. But then he started posting about how the Coronavirus was a media conspiracy because he didn't know anyone who had it, or anyone else who knew anyone. Then recently he started posting about this 5g causing it.\n\nIt's actually really sad. People who you think are at least somewhat all there in the head end up just being absolute morons.
