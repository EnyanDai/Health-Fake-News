Yes, the facilities are badly over-taxed, but Congress could alleviate the situation immediately by appropriating more resources. The  migrants aren\u2019t being held in the absence of due process, but in many cases at the beginning of a long asylum process. Finally, they aren\u2019t being held for the duration, but are released into the country in fairly short order, likely never to be removed.\n\nThis system is so permissive it has created an enormous incentive for more and more Central American family units to come. To suggest that there is anything immoral about this, let alone to associate it with some of the worst acts of repression in modern history or even with Nazi death camps is a profound and grievous error.\n\n>\tpushes for the same authoritarianism as China\n\nAlso lol about authoritarianism. The US isn\u2019t the country where police are being sent to people\u2019s doors to arrest/intimidate them because they dared to tweet about biological sex and how men aren\u2019t women.
