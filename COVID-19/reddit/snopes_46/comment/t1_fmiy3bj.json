It's also outright preying on people who do know they don't necessarily know everything about a topic, and think that maybe this is how things somehow work - it's not as if they know.\n\nCouple it with how this trash is spread through social media, and you have this crap gaining \"trust\" because you didn't just go find it and think \"eh what is the source\" - you were shared it by someone you know and care about, and it's been given a little nugget of your trust from that person through virtue of their sharing it. It's the difference between a stranger telling you some shit, and your friend telling you something. Who are you more likely to trust at face value? Except your friend got it from a friend who got it from a friend who got it  from a \"stranger\" looking to spread false narratives.", "created_utc": 1586119234.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmiy3bj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmhn4mt", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmiy3bj", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmiy3bj/"}
