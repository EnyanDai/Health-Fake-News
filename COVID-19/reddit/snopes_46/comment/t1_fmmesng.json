Virtually all the data contradict the dire alarms, according to public officials, including those at the World Health Organization(Link).    \n\nThis one is misleading because not even the WHO says that there  \nis valid reason to consider all kinds of wireless tech as \"safe\".  \nThis is from the WHO link from NYtimes:\n\n> The electromagnetic fields produced by mobile phones are classified by the \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer as possibly carcinogenic to humans.\nStudies are ongoing to more fully assess potential long-term effects of mobile phone use.\nWHO will conduct a formal risk assessment of all studied health \noutcomes from radiofrequency fields exposure by 2016.\n\n And that all for the regular cell phone usage we had in the last decades, *not* including 5G.\n\nThis is also  interesting to read on the [matter](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/cellular-phone-towers.html). Alltogether, what i have read so far, boils down to the point that cell phone usage over a long term \"might or might not\" lead to health issues (aka cancer), but that there too few studies on humans to prove either conclusion for sure.   \nWhich means, yes, it doesnt give you cancer on the spot or within a few weeks,  \n but we dont know for sure about *years*.   \nMight be a risk most are willing to take, but claiming \"scientists have said its safe\" is simply false.", "created_utc": 1586203968.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmmesng", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fml9zim", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmmesng", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmmesng/"}
