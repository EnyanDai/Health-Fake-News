I\u2019ve never worked on one after the fact, but my assumption is that it\u2019s mainly the silicon circuit boards, and wiring that catches on fire, and eventually gets hot enough to ignite the metal. \n\nSome people intentionally shoot guns at towers (which is a felony), but the occasion I mentioned with the lanterns was completely accidental. There was just a large festival on a windy day. Definitely not smart on the event planner\u2019s part, but certainly not intentional.\n\nAs far as damage is concerned, it\u2019s definitely a huge deal when it happens. The amount of regulations involved, not to mention the cost, makes it an extremely bad situation. The tower that was taken down by the the lantern was the only tower in a town, so everyone there was without service for months. It\u2019s less of a problem in bigger towns with multiple cell sites, because there\u2019s often some redundancy in place. You might drop more calls, or experience slow data speeds, but you\u2019ll probably be okay.
