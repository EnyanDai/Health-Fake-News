I agree it *could* be an issue. I agree that any new technology could be a problem. But when going against the scientific and technological consensus you need clear evidence.\n\nIf you look at the [health issues described here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G#Health_concerns), you'll see a lot of smoke but no fire. But you'll also see a number of people raising concerns as they should.\n\nMy contentions are:\n\na) There's no current evidence it's an issue. But:\n\nb) 5g is undergoing scrutiny from all over the world, and will undergo more as it goes on. *If* there's a problem with it, this will be proven. We won't have to rely on scare stories and what-ifs.\n\nc) The lesson I take from the cigarette industry, thalidomide, and the PPI industry is that big corporations are now hyper-aware that bringing in new technologies with future issues will definitely expose them to litigation and potential jail sentences. Again, history shows this can happen. I simply don't believe it can happen without challenge any more.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying there isn't an issue with 5g. But when you listen to the theories, \"5g is responsible for Covid-19,\" \"they aim to kill us all,\" \"this is a new population control system using harm frequencies,\" ... they are unmitigated bullshit. And the people pushing them are anti-science idiots. So we need to be very careful about enabling them.\n\nWe need, in fact, to be empirical about what has been proven and what hasn't.", "created_utc": 1585997820.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmebpb3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuetsu", "parent_id": "t1_fmeaubc", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmebpb3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fuetsu/broadband_engineers_threatened_due_to_5g/fmebpb3/"}
