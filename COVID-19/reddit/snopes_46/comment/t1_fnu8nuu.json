The irony here is hilarious.  Your sources compare man made EMF to natural **non ionizing radiation **   Hilarity ensures as not all natural EMF is non-ionizong.  Another fool who misunderstands what he reads and then pretends to be an expert.   Keep wearing tinfoil on your head.  I dont care.\n\nOh and natural ionizing radiation can absolutely go past the skin, damage DNA and cause cancer.  You dont know shit about any of this\n\nThe intensity of ionizing radiation from a cellphone, using 5G is orders of magnitude less than other common sources.  Intensity is directly related to power consumption, so unless you're ru ning 3 phase power to your phone....or, maybe if ypure dumb enough to climb a cell tower and put your head up against it.   \n\nAnd you can find papers on just about anything.  That doesnt ma  there is actually professional concern or any real concentrated effort to u derstand something.  This is pretty well understood.  It's like sophomore level physics here.  Lol\n\nAlso, cause you obviously dont know, but do you have any idea how powerful other sources are?  Airport radar, or doppler for weather, for example?  You could literally be cooked standing next to the transmitters?  Do you have any idea how much power radio uses to transmit?  Huge amounts.  But, no, no one talks about them because they're not the new boogeyman.  This whole thing is retarded.  And I actually have pedigree in this field.  I work with 100MW generators all day?  Have any idea what sort of fields those put out? Lol...no, we're going to worry about a cell signal because technology is bad and money is evil.
