Don\u2019t take my word for it or their word for it. Read it and think for yourself.\n\n\u201cIn summary, the majority of studies with MMW exposures show biological responses. From this observation, however, no in-depth conclusions can be drawn regarding the biological and health effects of MMW exposures in the 6\u2013100 GHz frequency range. The studies are very different and the total number of studies is surprisingly low. The reactions occur both in vivo and in vitro and affect all biological endpoints studied.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegarding the quality of the presented studies, too few studies fulfill the minimal quality criteria to allow any further conclusions.\u201d\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31540320/\n\n\u201cThe available studies do not provide adequate and sufficient information for a meaningful safety assessment, or for the question about non-thermal effects. There is a need for research regarding local heat developments on small surfaces, e.g., skin or the eye, and on any environmental impact. Our quality analysis shows that for future studies to be useful for safety assessment, design and implementation need to be significantly improved.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/\n\nA lot of what we consume and use is based off of these standards.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are several approaches to improve the post-study probability.\n\nBetter powered evidence, e.g., large studies or low-bias meta-analyses, may help, as it comes closer to the unknown \u201cgold\u201d standard. However, large studies may still have biases and these should be acknowledged and avoided\u201d", "created_utc": 1587246540.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fntpzbh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntk19d", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587266508.0, "name": "t1_fntpzbh", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fntpzbh/"}
