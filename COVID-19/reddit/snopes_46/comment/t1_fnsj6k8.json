Our bodies are exposed to \u201cradiation\u201d from many sources both natural and human made since birth.  This isn\u2019t a question of \u201cradiation\u201d, it\u2019s a question of understanding facts, physics, and science.  Time after time scientists and reports have proven that these wireless emissions are not harmful at the current safety levels.  5G is not much different than wireless devices that virtually most households in developed countries have next to their bed.  \n\nThe problem with this issue has to do with the fact that people refuse to believe scientists and experts.  Let me add one other point: due to spectrum propagation models, scientists and researchers are not disinterested when making conclusions.  In other words, it\u2019s not as if they can bubble themselves out of harmful radiation if in fact it\u2019s harmful.  So unless there\u2019s a global conspiracy by the entire scientific community, I would expect strong and wide consensus that RF emissions (not just 5G) is harmful.  Point being: it isn\u2019t but the people that refused to believe that don\u2019t really like the facts.", "created_utc": 1587222721.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsj6k8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fns43a0", "score": 226, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587231936.0, "name": "t1_fnsj6k8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnsj6k8/"}
