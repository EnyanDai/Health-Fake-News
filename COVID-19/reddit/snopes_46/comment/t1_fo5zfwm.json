China is united, focused and driven. Their plan has been in the making for dozens of years. It is time for European talents to pull together and start competing in the name of European values. \n\nI am worried that the overall lack of testicular power is gonna be the west's demise. Much like all the dem candidates pussied out and rallied behind creepy, war on drugs advocate, Iraq warmonger, Clarence Thomas apologist, slimy spineless potential rapist Joe Biden, it seems Western politicians and lawmakers only react to events. They react out of greed and fear to lose the safety of their position. No proactiveness, no initiatives.\n\nWe really lack a sense of urgency in the Western World. Things have been kinda meh for too long and we got complaisant in our slightly above mediocre state. Well complaisance isn't gonna cut it for much longer. China is hungry, powerful and unapologetic.
