If you think you are right, and have any interest in actually trying to convince people, then you would share links to the sources that have convinced you.**  \n\n**Saying, \"Do you research\" shows a gross unwillingness for you to acknowledge the vast amounts of the sources for these types of claims are clearly bogus youtube-style amateur channels and conspiracy theorist blogs.**     \n     \n**If you want people to take your position seriously, don't let them see your side presented by the least credible of sources, which is what they are more likely to find if they google on their own**.   \n     \n*I will give you an example of why its important to link sources:*     \n    \n*I could tell you that your number of vaccine compensation being 4 billion is true, it is a clear misrepresentation of the threat of vaccines. Not only, out of 3.5 billion vaccine doses have there only been 22,000 cases applied for this compensation, for a 1 out of 160,000 ratio, but only 7,211 cases actually got compensation, which is a ratio of about 1 out of 486,000.*    \n     \n*Also, the bar for when they compensate is low enough that there only has to be a symptom (from a list of possible injuries), which could have any number of causes, correlate in time with the vaccine. As such, \"Approximately 70% of all compensation awarded by the VICP comes as result of a negotiated settlement between the parties in which HHS has not concluded, based upon review of the evidence, that the alleged vaccine(s) caused the alleged injury.\"*    \n     \nI could just tell you that stuff, and expect you to take my word for it. However, you can hopefully appreciate how easily you could dismiss all of those points. I could have just made them up, and if these numbers are hard to find, it would be silly for me to expect you to somehow prove my numbers are fake.    \n     \nSo, in order to make my arguments far more effective, I will link sources.    \n     \n [Information on the number and payments of settlements.](https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vaccine-compensation/data/data-statistics-report.pdf)    \n     \n [Access to the direct quote of how 70% of compensations did not have evidence of causation.](https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/data/index.html)    \n     \n [List of injuries one must suffer in order to qualify for compensation.](https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/vaccinecompensation/vaccineinjurytable.pdf)    \n     \nInterestingly enough autism is not an injury that qualifies for compensation on that list and [since the very first case](https://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/cedillo.fedcir.pdf) has never qualified for compensation.", "created_utc": 1586158830.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkl74a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmkgm6u", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkl74a", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmkl74a/"}
