The air itself would feel hot, as that is what super heated (fast spinning) oxygen feels like. A single molecule of oxygen can\u2019t be spinning significantly faster than any others after absorbing energy then entering the lungs. It\u2019s energy would be diffused into surrounding molecules, and it certainly would be dissipated by the time it reaches the alveoli. It has to get through the entire trachea, bronchus, and bronchioles, which are kept at a temperature much lower than what\u2019s needed to hurt you.\n\nAnd even if a single, fast spinning molecule did manage to make it all the way to your alveoli and damage a hemoglobin, or even a bulk of the hemoglobin in that RBC, that damage would be sensed, and the RBC would be destroyed. As they pass through the spleen, malformed RBCs are recycled. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t make any sense for that to cause alveolar damage either, since oxygen freely diffuses across the pneumocyte\u2019s membrane.", "created_utc": 1583330409.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjgm6yf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fd2qdd", "parent_id": "t3_fd2qdd", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2emz4i", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjgm6yf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/fd2qdd/the_5g_coronavirus_connection_explained/fjgm6yf/"}
