Because it is actually a real thing. Face mask is different from N95 respirator masks that a lot are wearing. In the US for example the safety administration for businesses (OSHA) require companies that use respirators to have a respiratory protection program which includes medical clearance by doctors and fit checks to be preformed on a scheduled basis. The reason for the medical checks is prolonged N95 use can cause stress on your heart, so they have to get clearance that your cardiovascular system can handle it.  \n\nSo, it's not only a thing, but it's actually a pain-in-the-ass requirement from OSHA in the US at least. As a company that uses them mainly as dust-masks, it's a very serious fine for not having a respiratory protection program.\n\nI find it odd that so many on reddit are so dismissive of it and has decided that labor laws aren't there for the protection of employees.", "created_utc": 1589906355.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr5cn4e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr467jh", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr5cn4e", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr5cn4e/"}
