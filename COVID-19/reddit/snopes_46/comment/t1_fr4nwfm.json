I kid you not, I\u2019ve had to explain that in our country 35k or so have died, in a population of 67m. ~0.05%. A horrible number of absolute deaths but in terms of the population it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to bump into them ever in your lifetime. 250k infected confirmed, ~0.37%. Again, in percentage terms it\u2019s very low, thankfully. It\u2019s pretty well managed all things considered and still the health services are heavily impacted. It\u2019s really not a difficult concept to grasp but it\u2019s simply \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s had it.\u201d\n\nSo ignorant man. It hurts.
