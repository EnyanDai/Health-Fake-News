To get better positioning accuracy you need lower subcarrier jitter and latency not more towers. That requires simply due to nyquist, much much more bandwidth and that requires FR2 bands (60GHz) which we're not deploying here because the hardware is stupid expensive. At best 5G as deployed in the UK will give you 25m resolution which overlaps with LTE (4G) capability.\n\nEven if FR2 comes on line that gives 5m resolution at average and due to the 60GHz frequency being scattered and absorbed by atmospheric oxygen, the positioning accuracy gains are laughable marketing rubbish at the moment.\n\nBut none of this matters because cheap GNSS systems are good down to 1m. Really good ones down to a few cm.\n\nThe real problem is the software on your phone. It has access to your *precise* position via GNSS and your data. The mobile phone network has neither. So when I complain about people lamenting 5G as being the end of the world for tracking, the irony is the Android handset in their pocket, not the Chinese, not the government and not the wallies.", "created_utc": 1587117451.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fno9q68", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2xghp", "parent_id": "t1_fno7bz5", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fno9q68", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/g2xghp/coronavirus_concern_after_facebook_groups_call/fno9q68/"}
