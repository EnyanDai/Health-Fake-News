The future of 5G looks like a cell tower on every city block blasting high frequency radio waves within 25 feet of your brain everywhere you go. \n\nNow look at the comment below about military crowd control weapons and the frequencies they use to cause physical pain by using radio waves of a similar range. Not saying people will be in pain walking by a cell tower, but a lifetime subject to consistent radio wave streams - especially on growing adolescents - may have completely unpredictable results on our physical and mental health.\n\nThere is not nearly enough public concern or debate about whether this technology is fit for integration to our cities. And we're basically about to all be subject to a global guinea pig experiment - and this is all under the assumption that unmitigated technological advancement is for the betterment of society. The Idea is that our individual cities will only be able to compete on a global scale if we have the most up to date network infrastructure installed. IE: say Tokyo just installed 5G everywhere and now tech companies flock to create start ups in that city and leave places that are considered \"lagging behind on technology\" or \"not on the forefront of technological advancement\". The competition of the market in the end is whats impossible to control and inevitably has more influence over our own destiny than we do as individuals.", "created_utc": 1586102936.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmi5o3s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmi1w4h", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmi5o3s", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmi5o3s/"}
