You may find that if she has already mentally decided they are harmful 5G boxes that cause health effects, she will be unable to get past that - even if she calls the city and the engineers tell her every spec of every item pictured, complete with safety info. As I've mentioned, some people will come back with an excuse no matter what. To them, the engineer, the company who made it, they're all \"in on it\" and therefore lie to \"hide the truth\".\n\nIt's important to be open minded to whatever the truth is - and to not just doubt everything, and to not just look for evidence that proves us right (a big problem that I believe many older adults suffer from is searching in this way - ie searching Google for \"HOW HARMFUL IS 5G\" rather than \"Are there health effects from 5G\" or something neutral - everyone wants to confirm they're right. But this is just imho and a tangent and is tough to get data on.) \n\nI wish you the best of luck with it and have no idea if any of this applies to your situation or not, but this was one thought I had on the issue.", "created_utc": 1588905351.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpu5wa9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpttv1w", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpu5wa9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpu5wa9/"}
