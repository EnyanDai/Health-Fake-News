Invading Taiwan would definitely start a war and the US would help defend Taiwan. This is also backed by \u201cSolomon Yue\u201d the Vice Chairman  & CEO at Republicans Overseas simply saying HK isn\u2019t a national interest to the US but defending Taiwan is.  \n\nI don\u2019t want a war to start either but it\u2019s bound to happen. With genocide happening on Muslims, and my parents coming from Bosnia which in 1992-1995 faced genocide for being also being Muslim where also my father lost 70% of his family I feel an obligation to help. When money comes into play the nations are silent. Now Western nations are looking for a reason and will eventually find one to directly involve themselves.  Wars are expensive but the moral obligation they face and resources to compensate is an idea.\n\nI don\u2019t want anything to do with China and what spilt it into post-Germany WW2 but instead just reform the government. But with greed in the world I definitely think just the resources,territory\u2019s are a good reason to jump in for governments. It\u2019s an honestly complex situation but if we get that far into this problem where war is preparing I could even see UK jumping into saying China broke the Sino-British agreement and wanting HK back.", "created_utc": 1587551969.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo69uza", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rxpp", "parent_id": "t1_fo62w6r", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo69uza", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China/comments/g5rxpp/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo69uza/"}
