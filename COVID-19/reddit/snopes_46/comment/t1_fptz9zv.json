But seriously, like if you label someone a conspiracy theorist that is suppose to make ppl look at them more negatively. Here is the thing, ppl Rightfully do not trust corporations and or their governments. I do not know if 5g is safe or dangerous and any regular person who says they know for sure if it is or is not is an idiot. What I do know is that if there was a serious health threat with 5G, It is a guarantee that corporations will do everything in their power to keep people from finding out. So ...like I said while that is fucked up ehh it is what it is . My suggestion. Instead of attacking each other, find a rich suit with a fancy title in the establishment and focus your violence there.
