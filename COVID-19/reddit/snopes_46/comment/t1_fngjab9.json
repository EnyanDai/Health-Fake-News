We're probably as smart as we've ever been as a species, or close to it.\n\nIn the past hundred years or so, we've increased average IQ by an entire standard deviation. Someone who was in the 85th percentile of intelligence back then would be dead-on average now. That should actually be remarkable to people.\n\nI would argue that the modern crisis we're facing is not one of raw intelligence, but one of mental health.  Alternately, we face a problem with the law of truly large numbers and selection bias. There are a lot of people on the planet now&mdash;a lot more than there have ever been before&mdash;some of them are going to believe really stupid, crazy shit, and with modern technology, we're probably going to hear about it, because that will get clicks.
