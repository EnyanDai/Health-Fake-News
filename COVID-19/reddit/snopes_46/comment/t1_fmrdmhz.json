There could very well be two things happening simultaneously. WE are not seeing the kinds of outward physical effects that were being over played by the media when the pandemic was first announced in Wuhan. Since then it was discovered that Wuhan also had a roll out of 5g at the same time. ://www.sgtreport.com/2020/02/did-the-5g-rollout-in-wuhan-damage-the-innate-cellular-defense-cells-of-the-population-putting-the-people-at-risk-of-complications-and-death-from-coronavirus/ Now does that mean that it had an effect or a cause? Hard to get straight answers to most pressing questions these days. Could the roll out cause lung damage that creates an issue, could it be that the 5g was lethal and so this virus which has killed less people than previous flu seasons for obvious reasons is a cover story? Crazy flu issues every year. Last year and W.H.O. projected (guessed) that 600 thousand people died of the flu. Reports keep rolling in that many deaths from other causes are being attributed to the virus for sympathy and money from the state. So we witness the end to flu season. If the issues persist but perhaps only in countries who are rolling out 5g then we might have a real answer.
