What about people working on a cure who would would like to share information faster. What about people who don\u2019t have a home ISP account and just use their phone data and that\u2019s it? What about people who\u2019s networks are so overloaded and congested that they have trouble browsing the internet? Knowledge is truly power and I think you would agree there is a vast amount of knowledge available online. \n\nI don\u2019t disagree with you that faster internet isn\u2019t the most important thing right at this very time but don\u2019t try and act like this is something they started focusing on now that there is a pandemic. We\u2019ve been designing, testing, and building 5g networks for years now. \n\nWould you just suggest that these companies that have dumped billions of dollars into r&d, design, parts, government fees, employees, etc. just stop working on it because there is a pandemic? That would be like telling the cable/internet provider to stop maintaining/expanding their cable infrastructure. \n\nAlso as far as you not noticing any faster speeds, that could be because where you live, may not have 5G available yet. I know in the US there are only a couple cities that truly have 5G service and ATT changed their tag at the top of their screens to say 5GE which isn\u2019t actually 5G, it\u2019s 4G LTE with some new features. \n\nI would also like to add that there is a difference between quality of life and life necessities. I don\u2019t think faster internet is something we need, how you can\u2019t argue that faster internet and more bandwidth(which is actually the better feature of 5g over the speeds) wouldn\u2019t improve a lot of people\u2019s ability to do what they enjoy, there for improving QoL for those people.", "created_utc": 1587033501.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnkn7ap", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1trvy", "parent_id": "t1_fnkfd1t", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnkn7ap", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/g1trvy/the_coronavirus_is_caused_by_5g_is_a/fnkn7ap/"}
