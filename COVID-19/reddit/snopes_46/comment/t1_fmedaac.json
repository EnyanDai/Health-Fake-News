The main conclusion you can draw from their findings, is as they increase the energy of the radio wave, it becomes more harmful.\n\nThe frequency of a wave (in the case of your linked study, Radiofrequency) does not immediately make that wave harmful. The energy of the wave, is what makes it harmful.\n\nI couldn't find a write up on the parameters of the experiments that were concluded in your linked pages, so I'm going to assume they were under lab conditions. In cases such as infertility, they are likely directing radio waves at sperm cells. Well yes, that's obviously going to kill the cells. It's not a new conclusion and isnt a counter point.\n\nBelow is an article from the FCC. Feel free to click through the sections of the article, its summarised nicely.\n\nhttps://www.fcc.gov/engineering-technology/electromagnetic-compatibility-division/radio-frequency-safety/faq/rf-safety#Q6\n\nFinally, I'm not spreading any misinformation. Literally all I spoke about in my post was 'what makes electromagnetic radiation harmful?' And 'will 5G antennas produce em waves at a high enough power to cause harm?'.\n\nIf theres anything in my original post youd like me to clarify, then please do. The last thing I'd want is to get caught out unintentionally misinforming people.
