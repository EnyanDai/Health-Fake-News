I've been watching this unfold since January, I couldn't even get a n95 mask back then- which I only realized when my Friend in Shanghai asked me to send her some. Come March and I hear the authorities say you don't need to wear a mask, just wash your hands. So everybody walking around Walmart, with gloves, and purell, and fucking toilet paper, breathing all over eachother and the workers. fucking nurses and essential workers were prevented from wearing masks. \n  Honestly it feels like I am a bored 16 year old playing sim city trying to see how horrible he could fuck a situation up.
