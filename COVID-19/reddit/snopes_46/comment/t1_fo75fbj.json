There are assholes and nut jobs in EVERY group of people, but their presence doesn't justify stereotyping and insulting the entire group. \n\nBroad statements like \"Conservatives are uneducated morons who don't understand science\" or \"Liberals are all pansies who want a trophy and communism\"  are dangerous because they dehumanize an entire group of people and imply that it's acceptable to insult and discriminate against them based on a mostly superficial attribute. Yes, some people (from BOTH sides) take their party's rhetoric as gospel and use it as an excuse to be a jerk, but those people are the outliers and their behavior cannot be applied to the whole group. \n\nJust live the golden rule, man. If you don't like it when republicans say nasty things about democrats, then don't stoop to their level. \n\nStop with the negativity and look for goodness in people instead of spewing hate and intolerance because it's fashionable.", "created_utc": 1587572563.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo75fbj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "parent_id": "t1_fo5r3rm", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo75fbj", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskDocs/comments/g5fyvm/my_very_smart_dad_has_recently_started_reading/fo75fbj/"}
