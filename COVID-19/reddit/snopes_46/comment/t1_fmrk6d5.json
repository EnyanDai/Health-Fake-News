If there is an issue, it's not going to show up in short term small tests.  Sorry, but it's not like some giant death beam.  If there are problems, they'll be minor and hard to detect.  Regular tests will not uncover that.  We've already done short term tests.\n\nThe question is, if it rolls out, and actually is safe, how many people will cling to that it's not?  Conversely, if it's not safe, how many will do the same?  If no amount of evidence can change someone's mind, then their opinion is worthless.  It's passed the tests to roll out.  But those only will show short term effects, and likely at higher levels.\n\nWe learned a lesson with roundup.  It's great at what it does.  It allows a LOT more food to be grown at the same price.  However... It has issues.  A lot of issues.  But, on the other hand, it allows a lot more food to be grown in a way that's affordable to a lot people.  Shit is complicated.  Positives come with negatives.
