Wealthier countries can also afford a more aggressive implementation of 5G, meaning they can roll it out faster.\n\nWith that said, I'll conclude here. The infection rates seem to depend on one, or both of the following:\n\nHigh population density - the higher the population density, the easier it is for infection to spread via direct contact. Social distancing has been proven to work, although is harder to do in densely populated areas.\n\nWealth - wealthier countries typically mean a wealthier population. With more money to spend, people are more likely to travel to other countries and thusly increase their chances of becoming a carrier of the virus. That's how it has been able to travel from wuhan to other countries.\n\nI agree that there a more important matters than 5G for our governments to help fund. However provided its privately funded, I think 5G infrastructure is important to get setup as everyone is now using the internet non-stop and ISP's are struggling to keep up with the demand. Whether the work is essential to the point of rolling it out amidst a pandemic is a whole other topic!\n\nCheers for the question though mate :)", "created_utc": 1585998219.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmec1av", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuczaj", "parent_id": "t1_fmdf0ga", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmec1av", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fuczaj/robert_f_kennedy_jr_posted_this_regarding_5g_and/fmec1av/"}
