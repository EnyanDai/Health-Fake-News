The most recent, \u201cIs 5G Hazardous to Our Health?\u201d, alleges that children exposed to 5G signals will suffer cancer, nosebleeds, and learning disabilities. Another falsely says that higher radio frequencies are more dangerous to biological organisms, when in fact, as noted above, the opposite is true. As the New York Times explains, \u201cThe network is now applying its playbook against 5G by selectively reporting the most sensational claims, and by giving a few marginal opponents of wireless technology a conspicuous new forum.\u201d\n\n>These stories have since taken on a life of their own in the anti-Western and pro-Kremlin alt-media, which often have a symbiotic relationship with Russian propaganda outlets like RT and Sputnik. Already, a cursory search for \u201c5G dangerous experiment on humanity\u201d brings up an extensive list of hits to dubious sites peddling iterations of RT\u2019s original story, including many that EUvsDisinfo has previously identified as multipliers of pro-Kremlin disinformation.\n\n\n\n>The Kremlin \u201cwould really enjoy getting democratic governments tied up in fights over 5G\u2019s environmental and health hazards,\u201d said Molly McKew, head of Fianna Strategies, a consulting firm in Washington, D.C., that seeks to counter Russian disinformation.\n\n>RT\u2019s assaults on 5G technology are rising in number and stridency as the American wireless industry begins to erect 5G systems. In March, Verizon said its service will soon reach 30 cities.\n\n>RT America aired its first program assailing 5G\u2019s health impacts last May, its only one in 2018. Already this year, it has run seven. The most recent, on April 14, reported that children exposed to signals from 5G cellphone towers would suffer cancer, nosebleeds and learning disabilities.\n\n>Hundreds of blogs and websites appear to be picking up the network\u2019s 5G alarms, seldom if ever noting the Russian origins. Analysts call it a treacherous fog.\n\n>**Moscow\u2019s goal, experts say, is to destabilize the West by undermining trust in democratic leaders, institutions and political life. To that end, the RT network amplifies voices of dissent, to sow discord and widen social divides. It gives the marginal a megaphone and traffics in false equivalence. Earlier campaigns took aim at fracking, vaccination and genetically modified organisms.
