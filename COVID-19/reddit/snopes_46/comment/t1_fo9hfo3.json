None of that is linked to Corona, and doesn\u2019t even seem like Tati has done so here at all but hey it\u2019s easy to put words into people\u2019s mouths and laugh and call them a dumb stepford wife.\n\nIt\u2019s actual a valid concern on its own and it\u2019s like the members on this board are ALWAYS looking to be pro science, but even when the science is saying there\u2019s something to be concerned about you\u2019re ready to dismiss it and heap it into one big basket of crazy. \n\nThis is an actual issue, there\u2019s been zero testing done on the long term effects of 5G, and many existing issues with brain function, 4G and wifi. Like I said there are many experts from across the globe speaking out about it. \n\nThanks.", "created_utc": 1587619624.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo9hfo3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g6afbr", "parent_id": "t1_fo8ax1y", "score": -21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3jayp", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo9hfo3", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/g6afbr/tati_posts_about_5g_during_a_time_of/fo9hfo3/"}
