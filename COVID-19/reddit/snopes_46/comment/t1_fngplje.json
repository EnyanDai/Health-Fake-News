From there they can escalate it to apocylpse scenarios, or any desired target. It's especially effective if you can throw in some scientific terminology from wherever you pick up the initial threat (like solar flares).\n\nSound authoritive and leave the crazy stuff till the second half of the rant once people are already scared. \n\nOnce you have someone scared - their critical faculties severely decline - we start reacting with the part of the brain which deals with threats (the anygdala) which is primed to do fight/flight reactions - not the cerebrum which actually does the more logical/ evaluation type of cognition.\n\nIt's also worth noting this can be theraputic for people - if you are living in a state of low grade stress - like a lot of people are - it feels good after you have gone through a panic/rage cycle. It can flush the stress chemicals from your system.", "created_utc": 1586940255.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngplje", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngfvue", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngplje", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngplje/"}
