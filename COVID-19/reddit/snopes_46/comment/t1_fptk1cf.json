You cannot change the minds of anyone who is not willing to accept new beliefs, and every attempt to do so will only cause them to come up with new theories or ideas why you're wrong.\n\nSome do it because they're afraid of living in an ultimately uncaring and insignificant universe, and rather than come to terms with that they double down on the belief that humanity is inherently special. That there is no greater universe and the only thing that exists is this small celestial bubble.\n\nOthers do it because they think that they're smart. That they're the few that figured it out and can see past the bullshit. They've become so disillusioned with reality and disenfranchised by authority that they believe that everything they said must be lies.\n\nAt the end of the day, the same thing that all these conspiracy nuts have in common is fear and a superiority complex. If you're a pregnant woman who's filled with hormones that are making you especially emotional, and you read an article that says that vaccines might cause autism, wouldn't you at least feel a little scared for the life that you're carrying? What about 5G, where they're using powerful *radiation* waves? And now you've got a virus ravaging the nation, *coincidentally* at the same time all these things are happening?", "created_utc": 1588892697.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptk1cf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpstmxs", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptk1cf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptk1cf/"}
