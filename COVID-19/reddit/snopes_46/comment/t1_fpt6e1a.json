But yes, there are recent reports that indicates consensus of western intelligence agencies is aligned with what has been the consensus of scientific experts... \n\nThere's never been a reasoned/reasonable basis to assert a lab accident was a likely scenario.\n\nedit: where do you think they were more likely to be mishandling wild animals and not protecting themselves from possible infection... at a wet market or at a virus lab?
