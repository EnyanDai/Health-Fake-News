Covid = 5G, SARS = 4G, Radar = Hong Kong flu or something like that. \n\nOne of the 5G claims is that Wuhan was the first place to get 5G and every other location that has a huge outbreak has 5G. But he never mentioned that Iran did not have 5G operating and they had a big outbreak. \n\nI looked it up, yes each of those events occurred near the same time, but in each case the disease came first, not the technology. I spent 15 minutes on google and refuted all his claims. \n\nIn the case of radar it started on the opposite side of the world from the start of the disease. Even the Cancer Society has come out and said that 5G or other phone signals don\u2019t cause cancer. \n\nFucking morons have too much time on their hands right now.", "created_utc": 1586904164.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnfa0ru", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g11x0r", "parent_id": "t3_g11x0r", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_5r98w", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnfa0ru", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/FuckYouKaren/comments/g11x0r/when_somebody_says_5g_doesnt_cause_coronavirus/fnfa0ru/"}
