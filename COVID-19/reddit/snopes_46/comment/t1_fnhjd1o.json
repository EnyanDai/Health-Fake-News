Every day there are more and more things that you *don't* know about, and humans tend to fear what they don't know.\n\nFor example, someone who believes that a cell tower can spread a virus is operating on *total* ignorance on what cell towers and viruses are. Like, their knowledge of those things is the same as a 3-year-old's (i.e. none, zip, nada). It's questionable whether those types of people even know what electricity is. And so they place a willful agency behind absolutely everything, like ancient humans did with wind & rain gods.", "created_utc": 1586963484.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnhjd1o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngdwje", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586963836.0, "name": "t1_fnhjd1o", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnhjd1o/"}
