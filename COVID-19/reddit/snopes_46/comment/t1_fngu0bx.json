They actually have diverged into multiple groups who create even smaller echo chambers as they dismiss each other as insane or [retarded](https://www.reddit.com/r/demonstrably_level/). Another example is [Time Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Cube) guy Gene Ray had a [die hard fan and true believer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Cube#Suicide_of_Richard_Janczarski) just for Ray to denounce him.\n\nAlso having some personal experience with organizing events in the past, with some very eclectic group of people, you essentially just end up with insane people vying for power or attention until the people actually doing meaningful work just leave, the insanity forms an echo chamber, then it just falls apart soon after. Anarchists, Communists and Fascists aren't too different when it comes down to insane echo chambers. Just about anyone with a slightly moderate position gets pushed out inevitably.\n\nI think it's just overall mental illness, I did notice a lot of these people smoke cigarettes.", "created_utc": 1586944910.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngu0bx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngqh8k", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngu0bx", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngu0bx/"}
