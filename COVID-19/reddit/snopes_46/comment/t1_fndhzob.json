I just want answers, and I'm tired of trusting the word of a small group of, at best, questionable \"professionals\". who would never put money over the safety of people,  because of course they wouldn't want you having to spend all that money trying to fix the problems the transmitters could POTENTIALLY cause, that would only favor the people who park  their yacht's by their's at their vacation destination(s), \"its a big club, and we ain't in it\"", "created_utc": 1586870439.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fndhzob", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g0rx6e", "parent_id": "t1_fndfbg2", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586873424.0, "name": "t1_fndhzob", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/g0rx6e/5g_tower_fire_in_italy_during_coronavirus_lockdown/fndhzob/"}
