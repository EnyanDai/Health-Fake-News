Even if you are just generally concerned for your fellow mans safety. Adding chemicals to water, taking vaccines, and cranking out frequencies and transmissions  that If not kill bees and birds severely inhibit their functions are all things humans did perfectly well without 100 years ago.\n\nGod forbid you mention that and here come the defenders of this stuff left and right. It\u2019s not that all the shit is doctor doom bad, it\u2019s that we can live without it and don\u2019t need to be taking the risks involved with these things unless completely necessary. \n\nWe as humans need to work on doing less not more. \n\nBerate me people, please also use terms like my betters, and throw some insults my way. I\u2019m just trying to look out for everybody else.  \n\nAlso I respect people who defend these things as long as they protect the right to personal choice. \n\nWe as people don\u2019t need to be running around jamming needles down others arms if they don\u2019t want it. That is living in a Authoritarian society where they tell you can\u2019t put drugs a b and c in your body because they are fun but you have to let us main line you with this vaccine.
