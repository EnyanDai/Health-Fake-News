I'm constantly scanning news sources of all types, including some alternative news outlets because it's good to look at all of the info and fact check as best you can. Even on r/conspiracy, the idea that 5G caused covid was never mentioned in the hot topics, and if it was, it was there and gone with not too much attention. The problem with 5G in conspiracy circles has always been, from what I've seen, the idea that it can be used in a negative manner to track folks far better than any previous generation of tech. This is not mentioning the possible health consequences that many scientists have actually spoken up about if the technology is tampered with without public knowledge. Okay, now that being said, personally I think the flat Earth theory is dangerous because of its huge cult following. The members actually keep organizing and talk about making their own rockets to shoot people into space, or sending people out into Antarctica to find the edge of the world, which is bananas. I mean the following is big and growing, and they want to undermine thousands of years of science to perpetuate a bizarre theory no matter what the evidence. I'm certainly willing to change my tune on 5G when looking at good evidence, I mean hell I'm not even claiming that I believe 5G will be used nefariously personally, I just keep my eye on this stuff because government constantly overstep their boundaries, and perform damaging experiments on the population.", "created_utc": 1586190560.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmloz8s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmllyxa", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmloz8s", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmloz8s/"}
