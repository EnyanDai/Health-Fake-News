I didn\u2019t diverge from your argument I opposed it and in response you\u2019ve acted irrationally and instead of trying to counter anything I said with a actual example, you\u2019ve now doubled down on your own beliefs without showing me facts or examples of why your original statement was factual and wasn\u2019t anything more than your own opinion. \n\nReligions haven\u2019t said they know every answer they state what they believe their god told them, these facts have always been up for interpretation regardless of what science has said, since you used the Christian creation story I\u2019ll do the same, you can take it factual that god made the world in 6 days and created Eve from Adams rib or you can say those 6 days were ages of creation or a different amount of time for us than god, you can say Eve being created from Adams rib is DNA being reused or you can all say it\u2019s simply symbolism, furthermore religions haven\u2019t retreated, the Koran, Torah or Bible haven\u2019t had their texted reworded or deleted, they may have been translated into other languages and lost some meaning and others may have published their own version but the original bible is still available, the only thing that\u2019s changed have various churches have reinterpreted them based on scientific studies but that\u2019s not giving in to science that\u2019s listening to it. \n\nYour reinforcement of the point that religions can\u2019t be rational and reinterpret their texts based on science makes you hypocritical and your overall point that religions don\u2019t want people to be rational invalid. \n\nYou clearly haven\u2019t learnt that religions and science can coexist and still believes that religions somehow a bad thing and your holyer than thou attitude is grating. If you\u2019re not going to respond with a actual counter point which isn\u2019t your opinion please don\u2019t respond at all.", "created_utc": 1586170396.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkvn4p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmkoo85", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkvn4p", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmkvn4p/"}
