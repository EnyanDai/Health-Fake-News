As do I.\n\nAnd I brought up how few diseases there are that are transferable from the pet cat to humans. But there are a handful.\n\nSame thing with wildlife. Most diseases can't make the jump to human. Some can. All it takes it for a virus is mutate (and viruses mutate...it's what they do) to a form that can make the jump and then for some idiot to expose themselves to it.\n\nIt is, as I told my friend, a roll of the dice. Every once in a while, it comes up snake eyes.\n\nAnd that's what happened here. And what will keep on occasionally happening in the future as long as the Chinese\n\n1. Keep eating weird shit\n1. Have third world standards for butchering\n1. Continue their unhygienic livestock standards\n\nEvery once in a while, something over there is going to make the jump into humans. And in the meantime, numbers 2 and 3 will continue to curse us with the influenza every year. (Because Europe and North America also keep poultry, but notice that we never gift the world a bird disease every year. The flu comes out of China or southeast Asia.)\n\nThat line of reasoning woke my friend up and he dropped his conspiracy theory nonsense. One good thing that I'll say about my friend is that he spouts nonsense all the time, but he can be reasoned off it. Though, a lot of the time, the reasoning doesn't stick with him long and he goes back to the nonsense.", "created_utc": 1587079100.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnmvr4x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g2d5md", "parent_id": "t1_fnmjg85", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnmvr4x", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g2d5md/british_telecom_boss_reveals_39_engineers/fnmvr4x/"}
