No denying. But he doesn't know how to fight China. \n\nWhile the West was \"squeezing\" the Chinese for their cheap labor, hence for profit, Chinese made a pretty good deal for them. They were an underdeveloped country, so they traded cheap labor for technology blueprints. They had a pretty low economy, so they used the West to give them money and technology. They were smart and developed their own economy, with West aid, into a capitalist one and it boomed greatly. \n\nThey've been, discreetly, making massive deals in every other continent.\n\nNot a single super Nation thought they were capable of doing so, in just a short amount of time.\n\nThe fear of US leverage on the world is what's panicking most Trump, and most American leaders. Iran not selling oil in dollars had repercussions because of that leverage.", "created_utc": 1586522910.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmzk96h", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyaf2j", "parent_id": "t1_fmz6xqx", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmzk96h", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fyaf2j/canada_and_france_say_donations_of_coronavirus/fmzk96h/"}
