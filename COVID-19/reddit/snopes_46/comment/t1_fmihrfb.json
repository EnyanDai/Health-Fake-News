By itself it is a minor stress on your biology. Just like a pin-prick or cold weather is a minor stress. \n\nHowever human biology is now exposed to hundreds, if not thousands of minor stressors that did not exist 100 years ago. Chemicals in your food, water, in your house, car, on your clothes - EMF from wifi, radio, cell towers, power lines. You are exposed to this stuff in minor amounts 100% of your day. Almost of none of it will kill you by itself.\n\nHowever, combine this constant low level exposure with sedentary lifestyles, endless caloric intake, side effects of prescription drugs and lack of sun exposure - all things that are in direct opposition of what our biology has evolved to do.\n\nA single pin-prick is fine. Get 1000s of them and now you bleed to death. A little cold weather is fine, but at a certain temperature for a period of time and now your biology can't keep you alive.\n\nThe modern combo of 1000s of minor stressors combined with modern lifestyle is one of the ways you get something like cancer. So yes, 5G ain't helping in that department.", "created_utc": 1586109821.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmihrfb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmi4ado", "score": -10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586114326.0, "name": "t1_fmihrfb", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmihrfb/"}
