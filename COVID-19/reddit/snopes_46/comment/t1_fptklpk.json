You could join him, have a talk, have a laugh, or walk away shaking your head. But Ron wasn't doing any damage on his own so all was good.\n\nThen the internet became more accessible and user friendly and.. I unfortunately called it wrong. I thought \"Hey, with all this info and instant access to anyone globally we should be headed into a hyper progressive state where humanity finally joins forces and we can be more like Star Trek.. or Troopers if we encounter big bugs.\". Ideally I thought racism would die out and aggressive military actions would decline. But I forgot about people like Ron.\n\nCrazy Ron isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. He ain't straight up stupid, but he's the type of guy that squeaked out of grade school, clings to conspiracy theories, and thinks businesses and the government are out to screw him. Again, on his own he isn't much of a problem, but with access to the internet he is.\n\nOne of the worst parts about today's internet are Ignorant Pocket Communities, places where you can anonymously interact with like-minded people (like some of the subreddits found here). These are communities that feed into an Echo Chamber, always ignorant, often hateful, sometimes harmful. They quickly ban/mute/kick \"positive infiltrators\" as it disrupts their agenda. Where once upon a time you could sit down with Ron face-to-face and discuss his insanity, now he can ignore you digitally. Nowadays Ron is supported by a large group. His conspiracies grow larger as ideas are being shared. He starts taking action because he has backing. And no one can talk to him anymore about it because he's not in the corner drinking a beer spouting out bs, now he stays at home on his PC/phone and brews his ignorance.", "created_utc": 1588893005.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptklpk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptclg1", "score": 38, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptklpk", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptklpk/"}
