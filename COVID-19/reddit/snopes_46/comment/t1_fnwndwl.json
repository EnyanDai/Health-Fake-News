I think we are all aware that cigarettes were speculated to have caused lung damage well before it really became accepted. So I get the concern. My grandmother used a device that irradiated part of the face to combat acne lol, so yes I get the concern here. I am dubious all the same when people talk about \"definitive proof\" of this, reacting by wanting to shut down communication towers one way or the other or through lawsuits for things like their cancer (whereas they dont live nearby a cell tower), and so on.", "created_utc": 1587321708.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnwndwl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fnwlrk8", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnwndwl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnwndwl/"}
