Starting with the bullshit revisionist idea that the US was telling China it\u2019s data was wrong. Trump was too busy congratulating his \u201cgood friend President Xi\u201don doing a good job and being \u201ctransparent\u201d. If you have an issue with licking another country\u2019s leader, look no further. The fact is the US had no clue what was going on (not least because Trump fired the people whose job it was to know - both in the White House and on the ground in China). These are fact. Not theory. \n\n\n2. Then there\u2019s your bullshit notion that the WHO was busy telling everyone it was \u201cnot transmittable\u201d. \n\nWhere (reputable) did that come from?!\n\nThe WHO WERE WARNING THE WEST TO PREPARE, TO TEST AND ISOLATE AND BE READY TO CONTACT TRACE throughout February and March. Check out WHO\u2019s Mike Ryan (amongst others) and what he was saying. \n\nAll that advice and advance notice fell on deaf ears of two leaders in particular: Tinybrain Trump and Bullshit Boris. \n\nLook at what each of them were saying at the time. \n\nAnd now look where both countries are...\n\nAmericans have every right to be outraged at Trump\u2019s incompetence in the job he holds that incompetence is now costing thousands of American lives. Not just alienating all of America\u2019s allies. \n\nBrits the same with Boris.\n\nEdit : Adding link to interview with Ex WHO official who explains how the WHO operates \n\nhttps://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/nymag.com/intelligencer/amp/2020/04/how-trumps-coronavirus-blame-for-who-and-china-falls-flat.html", "created_utc": 1587570298.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo70xaj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rr17", "parent_id": "t1_fo6x4il", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587572895.0, "name": "t1_fo70xaj", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/g5rr17/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo70xaj/"}
