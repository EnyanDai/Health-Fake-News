The only reason we have those records is from leaks post soviet collapse and us foai requests on decades old events being declassified. Current ops still exist and are still classified in the US... Russia, China, EU, and other acting countries / private interests will only be exposed by leaks. Yellow journalism and misinformation campaigns have been a constant since the dawn of the most basic media. This is nothing new. The only way it works is if the motives and actors remain secret, so if its working in current events, you don\u2019t know about it, but it is definitely nothing new if you dig through history. Generally that history isn\u2019t presented to you through msm either, since they have an interest in keeping it less known to promote confidence in their media vehicles that have historically been exploited.", "created_utc": 1588902627.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpu1g1m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt04i9", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1588902831.0, "name": "t1_fpu1g1m", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpu1g1m/"}
