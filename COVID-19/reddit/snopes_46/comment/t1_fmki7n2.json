And yes, I am not saying people used to get super educated before, but I feel like we really SHOULD be all much smarter at this day and age.", "created_utc": 1586155813.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmki7n2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmkhcel", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmki7n2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmki7n2/"}
