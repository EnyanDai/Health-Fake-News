They were used in my culture for various things, but really they just help facilitate a stronger connection with the Earth.\n\nThey don't magically cure illnesses or do anything like these goofy ass people think. They don't understand what they even are, in an etheric sense. \n\nPrivately, I even put more stock in them as a spiritual tool, but using them per the indigenous practices I was taught takes a lot of care. \n\nThe crystals people sell on Instagram are often heat/titanium treated in a lab, have fake terminations, are *literally* fake (google fake citrine and real citrine and you'll be amazed at what these people will let themselves be convinced is real, or \"angel/aura quartz\") ... it's a huge affront to my beliefs that people \"use\" them so stupidly.  Now everyone thinks crystals are a joke because of Karens. \nMakes me incredibly sad and I feel it's just another way culture vultures are molesting the natural world to their benefit.
