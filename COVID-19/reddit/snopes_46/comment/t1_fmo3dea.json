I'm impressed.\n\nYour baseline point is that Remain = Intelligent, because Intelligent People Voted Remain. When presented with a theory that Remainers do something stupid, which would disprove your theory, then the only solution is that these stupid people didn't vote Remain!\n\nYou can't have it both ways. You can either make sweeping generalisations, or you can not.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n> As in, if you had a university degree you were overwhelmingly likely to vote remain.\n\nYes, but this actually isn't very meaningful. Young people are overwhelmingly likely to have a degree when compared to older generations due to a massive uptick in university attendance. We haven't gotten smarter in the intervening years, it's just that degrees are no longer a marker of high intelligence. The average university student is now barely above average intelligence. What *is* more likely is that young people are more socially liberal, and university students in particular are very socially liberal, and Leave/Remain was always split on Social Liberal vs Social Conservative (and had nothing to do with being left/right wing on economic grounds).", "created_utc": 1586243903.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmo3dea", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fw125q", "parent_id": "t1_fmmtkwp", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmo3dea", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/fw125q/at_least_20_uk_phone_masts_vandalised_over_false/fmo3dea/"}
