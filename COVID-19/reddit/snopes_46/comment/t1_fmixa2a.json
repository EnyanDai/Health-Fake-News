My question was on why you think the virus is man-made. You have not answered this one question.\n\nI understand the issues around China, and what they've done to initially cover up the situation. I live in Singapore, which is closer to the action, and we kinda got hit by the first wave of infections after the virus spread out of China. I understand the politics around China's propaganda, and I also understand the motivations for arresting and attempting to muzzle the doctors to speak out.\n\nBUT I also understand that this kinda outbreak has happened before with SARS on 2003, which followed the same beat. For you, the current pandemic is probably some unprecedented scifi shit that's happening in your backyard, but here in Asia, it's not new, it's well documented, and as a consequence, there's a lot less of the conspiracy-theory mongering. This is how virus pandemics work, most of us know this, we learn this, and we learn how to deal with it.\n\nThe criticism around China is for how it dealt the crisis initially, and for some of politicking they're doing when instead the focus should be on saving lives. Please for the love of god do not conflate this with some insidious man-made biowarfare conspiracy, IF you don't have anything to back it up.\n\nAsking for sources does not mean I'm blindly trusting the government. You, on the other hand, have given nothing but unsubstantiated conjecture that wouldn't pass a schoolkid's logic. Your distrust of authority stems from something, and I really hope you be a little more introspective about it.\n\nAt the very least, please don't push your unsubstantiated opinions onto your family and present it as some likely truth. That's what you've been doing on this thread. Fake news, if misinterpreted and misapplied, can harm. Your friends and family don't deserve that.
