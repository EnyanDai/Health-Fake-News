John McAfee is 100% in this sort of crowd and he was a software engineer, its hard to be _that_ thick as a software engineer.  \nThey're not necessarily thick, they might be quite clever in isolated pockets of information, knowledge or interaction, they're just incapable of holding a solid model of the world in their head and thinking through the ifs and buts. A big part of it is lacking the self-doubt in a pet theory you might have.   \nBecause of this, any theory to a given problem has potentially the same weight as any other and if they're exposed to convincing people pushing particular theories they may well end up latching on, especially if it relates to part of their own environment or identity. e.g. The same way that anti-vaxxers pull from the hippy scene because that correlates with \"anti-pharma\" and \"anti-corp\".\n\nI think \"Better Call Saul\" does a pretty good job of accurately personifying the kind of madness at play here with Saul's older brother who outside of his \"electromagnetic madness\", is exceptionally rational and sane.", "created_utc": 1586211812.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmmtkd6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fw125q", "parent_id": "t3_fw125q", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586219941.0, "name": "t1_fmmtkd6", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/fw125q/at_least_20_uk_phone_masts_vandalised_over_false/fmmtkd6/"}
