That's why radio can transmit miles but WiFi struggles to get upstairs sometimes. Pretty basic stuff right?\n\nSo with 5G the plan is to develop cheaper, smaller access points with smarter beamforming strategies and deploy more of them.\n\nIf you can look at which nodes someone is connecting to---and you can---then more nodes with shorter ranges means more accurate tracking. So yes theoretically this could be one more tool to make it a little easier for e.g. the police to locate you, but as always it's an incremental change not a revolutionary one.\n\nAnd that said it's probably safer to assume they can already track you with sufficient accuracy with or without 5G if they really want to and that it'll make no difference. To be clear I'm not saying I agree with them that it's something to be concerned about, I'm just saying that there is at least some logic to what they're saying.", "created_utc": 1587028635.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnkis9x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1ud0b", "parent_id": "t1_fnhuh84", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587029003.0, "name": "t1_fnkis9x", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/g1ud0b/vandals_set_50_cellphone_masts_in_the_uk_on_fire/fnkis9x/"}
