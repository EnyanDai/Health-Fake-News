It has been that way since the beginning of time and is a, \"natural\" human function. \n\nCatastrophe events become biblical tales of fate for those who sinned. Feudal overlords become dragons and vampires in the same way they become intergalactic paedophile cult reptiles bent on a one world government. \n\nReinterpreting events redefines them and gives power back to those who feel disempowered placing them as the central characters and ultimate heroes of a new story. Vanquishing a villian. \n\nIMO: YouTube shouldn't ban these videos it is upto others to demonstrate that they are safe rather then introduce new technologies that infringe on peoples personal space (atmosphere and environmental) without respect for it. Am not into these theories myself but do feel that our personal atmospheric environmental space needs to be respected as these technologies advance. \n\nI perhaps wouldn't want one of these masts on top of my home.", "created_utc": 1586154030.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkgd7u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkgd7u", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmkgd7u/"}
