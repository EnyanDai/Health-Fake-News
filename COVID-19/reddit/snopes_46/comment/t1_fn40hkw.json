This is the claim, I'm still looking for evidence it does interfer with the hemoglobin's ability to absorb oxygen though. A study on that saying it doesn't would shut this whole thing down. \nMust be a study somewhere proving it one way or the other. If not it should be done then the conspiracy should be done. \n I shall try and find out if such a study exists.\n\nhttp://emftests.com/countless-studies-show-5g-frequencies-cause-illness/\n\nJust found this which links to various studies. \nI'm interested now tbh. I was only parroting what have been talking about hoping someone would have some sort of valuable information to out me right. Now it seems their is actually some weight to 5g not being good for us.", "created_utc": 1586631565.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn40hkw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyszf4", "parent_id": "t1_fn3yzo9", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586631854.0, "name": "t1_fn40hkw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fyszf4/5g_is_not_linked_to_the_coronavirus_pandemic_in/fn40hkw/"}
