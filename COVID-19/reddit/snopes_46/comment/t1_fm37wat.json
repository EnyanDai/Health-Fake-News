I can't claim to read Johnson's mind. But I could see how someone like him might have thought a Huawei contract was a good move, in the way that you might want to diversify a portfolio; you don't remain too dependent upon any one country, be it the US, EU member countries or China. But the fallacy there, that nationalism obscures, is a kind of false moral equivalancy between other nations. You're not blind to China's flaws, necessarily, but you falsely assume all governments are really playing by the same Hobbesian rules. Thus, you might, like certain US Presidents, assume that sure, they lie cheat and steal to help their country, but everyone does it, including us, so what's the big deal?\n\nBut that's emphatically not true. Whatever legitimate criticisms could be had about the early responses to COVID19 in the US, UK and Italy, these countries did not attempt any cover-ups, arrest or disappear whistleblowers, lie to international community and their own citizens, and so forth. The PRC isn't just a normal government. The CCP party-state is more a mafia organization masquerading as a nation-state.\n\nI trust that Boris Johnson is now learning that lesson the hard way. I'll give him this: he's a smart guy. Hopefully, he'll also be a quick study. And personally, as critical as I am toward most politicians of all ideological and partisan stripes, I'm not one to give them too much grief for changing their views and policies as long as they are moving in the right direction. We shouldn't make it too hard for them to do so; to the contrary, we should make it as easy as possible for them to evolve according to newly revealed facts.", "created_utc": 1585715229.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm37wat", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fs11kb", "parent_id": "t1_fm0gg8j", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm37wat", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China/comments/fs11kb/the_coronavirus_is_becoming_a_public_relations/fm37wat/"}
