They've shut it down.\n\nSo, I would assume this would be the big right-wing subreddit, but it's not really.  They are obviously trying to sway the election or something.  They can't even let pro Trump people talk amongst themselves.\n\nEdit: There's still r/4chan, obviously the Trump subreddit wasn't banned for being too bad, it's political.\n\nThey must moderating r/conservative heavily, because you expect them to come here, but you see barely anything.
