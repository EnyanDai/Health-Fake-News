Networks are shared resources with a limited amount of capacity. The more users connecting to a network, the more individual connection speeds suffer. Jio garnered 100 million subscribers in a space of six months, and it gave those customers nearly free reign to consume as much data as they liked. Such a huge onslaught of 4G data usage would tax any network, no matter how powerful.\" \n\nSource: https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2017/04/india/state-of-the-mobile-network\n\nIndia report from 2018:\n\"State of Mobile Networks: India (April 2018)\nIndian operators are hearing the call of 4G revolution. In the last six months, we have measured substantial improvements in 4G availability in India, as operators have made access to LTE signals a new priority\"\n\n\". We saw huge jumps in this metric from Airtel, Idea and Vodafone. In our last report none of these three operators had an LTE availability score higher than 65%. Now all three have surpassed that bar,\" \n\nNew capacity for 100 million 4g capacity in the same year as 300% increase in cancer.
