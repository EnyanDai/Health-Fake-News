And EU has been passively watching these companies giving stuff for free without worrying about their citizens privacy. Even the GDPR in the end is a banner with an accept button and nothing really changed. Now everything EU citizens do online is tracked by a few giants which are all US companies. And you see the result. Youtube suppressing opinions. Today is the conspiracy theories, what is going to be tomorrow? Something the american government does not like? And you have no alternative. There is no EU browser. There is no EU google or facebook. While others understood the next battlefield was user data none in EU invested in this but were worried about how much milk you are allowed to produce or how bent a banana should be to be called a banana. The impact of fake news on social media is huge. But the problem is it is hard to fight fake news even if you are the US government. For EU there is not even the chance to try. Others will decide what is true and what is not. But hey you had a button to choose which browser to use even if you could have installed it by yourself!", "created_utc": 1586113765.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmiomk5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t1_fmik3az", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmiomk5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmiomk5/"}
