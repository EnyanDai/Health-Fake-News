In the UK in 2017/18, both BT and Vodafone removed and replaced- for free- all compromised CEs from any customer with an HSI provision of about 2Mbps (not xDSL customers) or higher. I know this because I assisted on this project. It was mostly precautionary, but the 'bugs' (which could have been considered handy backdoors for the NSA toolkits, which by then were out in the wild thanks to Fancy Bear) were found in far too many mainline bits of router code.  \n\n\nThat was an expensive mop-up that the telcos took the hit on for free, and was partly the reason for thinking about a zero-trust model for all vendors to include contractual code inspection, which GCHQ are alluding to. The same vulns were present in the MPLS-facing CEs of course, but that wasn't  really a problem. Cisco are always going to be part of our networks, but no vendor can be considered entirely 'friendly'.", "created_utc": 1587197400.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnrq4rs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3iiuz", "parent_id": "t1_fnrp3ua", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnrq4rs", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/g3iiuz/uk_moves_to_drop_huawei_as_5g_vendor_citing_china/fnrq4rs/"}
