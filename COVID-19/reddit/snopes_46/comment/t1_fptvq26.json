{"author": {}, "body": "I've worked for Bell Canada since 2007 and don't really understand the upset with 5G. I'm a Conservative, don't buy into the conspiracy theories. I will say that back when cellular was just taking off in a mass scale in the 90's, there were multiple reports of people who were subscribers that developed brain tumours near their ears of whichever dominant ear they used the handsets. There were even small devices advertised on television to place in the earpiece to block and lessen exposure to the body. \n\nhttps://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/brain-spinal/risks/?region=on\n\nI mean, I can tell you that 5G is very expensive and will only be made available to consumers in major metro centres. The remaining subscribers will have 4LTE. There are only so many devices that even have 5G capability. For the entire network to be 5G would increase service by a significant amount to the consumer. So if you're in a larger city, in the downtown area, you'll be able to use 5G, if you have a 5G Device. The speeds between 4LTE and 5G aren't all that noticeable, maybe a little, but not enough to pay an extra $50/month. \n\nAs for the conspiracy theories, these individuals are like everyone else. Conservative/Liberal, everyone's got an us vs. them thing going on and it's just ridiculous.\n\nThen again, what do I know... I've only been in the industry for 15 years. \n\nWishing everyone good health and happiness.\n\nWith love from St. Catharines, Ont.", "created_utc": 1588899223.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptvq26", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t3_gfbygc", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptvq26", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptvq26/"}
