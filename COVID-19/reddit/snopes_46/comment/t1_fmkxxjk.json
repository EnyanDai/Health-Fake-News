(Not claiming expertise here, just the knowledge I have). 5GHz are radio waves just like any other radio waves.  Most cell towers emit 10W with a maximum of 50W at the tower itself. That's less than a typical lightbulb. There is absolutely no way there can be RF damage to cells at those insignificant levels. Your cell phone is more dangerous. It can put out 2W next to your head. That should take more precautions than 5G. Should there be more research? Yes, but only just to settle the matter.   \n\n\nPeople cite what radio waves do to cells and their potential danger. Yeah, if you are right next to a 1000W source like inside a microwave. That's absolutely not the case here. It's like thinking the planets have an impact on us with their gravitational pull. These forces are barely measurable let alone having physical impact. It's ludicrous.   \n\n\nBut what is part of the 5G narrative that is more ludicrous is the belief that it's causing the cells to produce the virus itself. It's biologically impossible and there is absolutely no science to back that up. I don't care if that Australian dude says he's studied it for years. I could study flat earth for years and any conclusion I would attain would be BS. If 5G caused this then Covid19 would have erupted simultaneously across the globe wherever it was implemented.   \n\n\nSo to all the 5G theorists, produce hard evidence or let the adults in the room talk.", "created_utc": 1586172781.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkxxjk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvf99x", "parent_id": "t3_fvf99x", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkxxjk", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvf99x/youtube_to_suppress_content_spreading_coronavirus/fmkxxjk/"}
