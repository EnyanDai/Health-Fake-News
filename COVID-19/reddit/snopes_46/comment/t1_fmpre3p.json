But it's not an uncommom belief. The reptilian bit is odd, but there are theories about the origin of our species being a race on intellectually superior alien beings (annunaki) splicing theiR DNA with primates to create humans as a slave race. \n\nThe stories get even trippier than that when you talk about archons, lumerians, arcturians, hathors, all these different \"races\" and beings... \n\nI think the main idea stems from theories of consciousness and believing that humans are actually very of place on earth and it is odd that only one creature evolved consciousness and has risen to live in such discord with nature. \n\nI've looked into some of the stories out of curiosity. Wild stuff. But honestly, how fucking ridiculous does the concept of the \"big bang\" sound? That's some dogmatic shit straight out of a religious playbook. Can't really explain or prove this... So here just believe this!\n\nEqually ridiculous are people who believe the creation myth is literal and that the Earth is mere millennia old. \n\nEven crazier are the people who think we really have anything figured out or that anything can be proven. We aren't the only \"intelligent\" creatures in the galaxy, and we are definitely not anywhere near the smartest.", "created_utc": 1586285949.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmpre3p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwkcwo", "parent_id": "t1_fmpnj83", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmpre3p", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwkcwo/youtube_tightens_rules_after_david_icke_5g/fmpre3p/"}
