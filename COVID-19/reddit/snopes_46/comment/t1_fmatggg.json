Its amusing having to teach people the concept of non-ionizing radiation. However, at the same time, I feel that telecommunications have been doing a shitty job of educating people themselves.\n\nIts really the whole vaccines thing all over again. Yes, vaccines don't cause autism but medical professionals have done a pretty shitty job when it comes to adequately inform the public on how they work. And then when parents are often asked to sign a bunch of forms basically absolving those administer these types of drugs from any culpability, its obvious that people are going to latch onto their worst suspicions.\n\nSo yes, simply labelling all conspiracy theorists as idiots is not enough. There is a good chance neither of you have a good grasp on how RF transmissions, radiation or telecommunications bandwidths work either. I feel the government and industry should be doing more to produce better and more rigorous independent studies on potential dangers (yes, I am well aware the chances of \"radiation poisoning\" from 5g emitters is likely null). Because, whilst the bandwidths for commercial and public use are obvious not harmful (I think maximising at the 90MHz range), certain high energy and high frequency emissions genuinely can cause complications if continuously exposed (high energy/UHF radio towers tend to be high up in the sky for a reason). I have a strong feeling people are getting these confused and its whats causing the panic.", "created_utc": 1585907164.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmatggg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fu4x2o", "parent_id": "t3_fu4x2o", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585911694.0, "name": "t1_fmatggg", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fu4x2o/uk_media_outlets_told_not_to_promote_baseless_5g/fmatggg/"}
