A theory must be considered to be false until it is proven to be true. I can *entertain* it being true, but I must assume for all practical purposes that it is not. **Nowhere do I suggest ignoring evidence.**\n\nYou seem to be under the illusion \"genuine evidence\" was an attempt to give a personal stamp of approval; it was not. It was obviously just a generalistic reference to evidence that isn't made-up or otherwise. For example, a scientific discussion might expect something replicable such as results with a detailed methodology or mathematical model to be scrutinized. \n\nWe can run around in circles here, what I'm explaining to you is not some revolutionary idea. If you believe something before it is able to be proven, it is nothing more than that: a belief. I have many beliefs, as likely do you. We can pursue these beliefs in hope of breakthrough, but until we are able to do so those beliefs should be considered false by all others, not placed on national television for Eamonn Holmes to peddle as possible truths.
