Not us pillaging and burning the planet for profits, or for people raping and mutilating animals for taste and pleasure? But because some aggressive and passionate lost people are trying to fix something they don\u2019t understand? Yes they are lost, and so are you if this is what makes you angry. Turn your rage towards the right people and causes. These actions are just the result of a sick system that just isn\u2019t working for its people. The 5g towers may not be poison but the people paying for them to go up aren\u2019t the poor victims you\u2019re making them out to be. And I do agree with your post. People are for the most part ignorant, violent creatures. They also tend to find safety in numbers and herd mentality.
