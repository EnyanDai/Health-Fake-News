It was some made up propaganda to trick people into thinking that the EU was going to remove our ability to veto in the year 2020.\n\nThe thing that stood out to me about this particular piece of propaganda is that the source of this wasn't some professional looking website; trying to present itself falsely as some sort of authority on the issue.\n\nIt wasn't some figurehead claiming it on TV/radio stations while once again trying to act like they have some authority and knowledge on the matter.\n\nNo, it was spread via facebook and twitter posts.  It was a big rant, all in upper case without a single source attached to it.\n\nIt gained so much traction that [fact check sites had to respond to the claims](https://fullfact.org/europe/viral-list-about-lisbon-treaty-wrong/).\n\nThis piece of propaganda didn't even do the bare minimum of trying to present itself as something legit but still got believed.  So imagine the amount of tripe from professional looking websites which are basically blog sites for conspiracies that must get believed on a regular basis.", "created_utc": 1587218079.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnsbrmr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fns9xw8", "score": 152, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnsbrmr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fnsbrmr/"}
