Production is done in China because it\u2018s cheap (or used to be). None of the tech is actually developed there, it\u2018s not a necessity that production got outsourced there but was done to maximize profits. However now because of the unstable political situation there is a new cost in the form of extra risk producing in China (as well as rising wages) and many companies have actually already begun moving at least some of their production out. Even local companies too, they\u2018re outsourcing to SEA and Africa. \n\nFor developed nations, they urgently need to divest from China, they\u2018re all way overexposed to the liability that is the CCP regime. At the time, back in the day all the companies moved there, many thought the system would gradually open up with more economic development. This hasn\u2018t happened, on the contrary it\u2018s actually gotten worse in the last few years.", "created_utc": 1587576861.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo7ea3w", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rr17", "parent_id": "t1_fo6g5c9", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo7ea3w", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/g5rr17/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo7ea3w/"}
