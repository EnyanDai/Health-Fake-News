I had a dude on twitter saying that in my country we are seeing the curve go down only because the government is pushing the hospitals to take less people in and not ICU everyone. \n\nSo people die at home without being a statistic for Covid19. Then he added, thats where I found out he was batshit crazy, those dead people were a blessing for a politcal party that was pro organ donation. He defended his theory for several tweets and changed the subject on me and my tweets instead. His whole account is based on bashing the government with all sort of conspiracy theories. \n\nI am new in twitter and thought it would be fun having short discussions.
