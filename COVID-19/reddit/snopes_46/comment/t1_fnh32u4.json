You seem to be pulling a straw man there yourself.\n\nFrom your posts here you seem to be a proponent of this conspiracy theory, if not, perhaps I misinterpreted your post. Feel free to clarify your position on this.\n\nI completely stand by my statement that 5G causes COVID-19 is obviously bullshit and completely batshit crazy because it is. EM radiation cannot cause a viral infection. Why you are acting like this is not a factual statement is beyond me.\n\nRegarding the \u201cScience behind this belief\u201d I didn\u2019t so much cherry-pick a source as blindly followed the first link from your suggested google search which happened to be an analysis of various studies on the potential health impact of EM radiation primarily in the 30-60Ghz range. Which seemed a reasonable enough study. \n\nThat study looks at wider health impacts and has an inconclusive result. \n\nI didn\u2019t go from:\nIt\u2019s not true. It\u2019s completely batshit crazy.\nto\nYour suggested study says studies that are available on the subject are inconclusive\n\nThose two statement are referring to two separate things. The first is 5G causes COVID-19 which is batshit crazy, the other is the conclusion of the study on wider health impacts of 5G. Those wider health impacts being inconclusive and not controlled for the temperature effect of EM radiation absorption.\n\nThose who lack reading comprehension shouldn\u2019t be trying to criticize the debate skills of others. \n\nOh and don\u2019t call people boy, you egotistical prick.", "created_utc": 1586953543.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnh32u4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g14cs6", "parent_id": "t1_fngzv1f", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnh32u4", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/g14cs6/coronavirus_ireland_5g_arsonists_target_mobile/fnh32u4/"}
