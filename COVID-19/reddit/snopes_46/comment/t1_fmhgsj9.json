Which is why all sites designed and deployed with 5G (and 4G) must be strictly compliant with ICNIRP regulations, which allows for safe/sufficient dissipation of the RF over distance. This has been in place for 15 years - and was recently reviewed and approved to account for 5G. \n\nEach Antenna has an RF \u201cfootprint\u201d that is modelled using a piece of software called PROX-5. Tht is takes into account height, bearing, power and occupational/public zones. \n\nThe antennas must meet strict rules to be compliant with this process.\n\nIf all of the cumulative frequencies on any given site (you could have 4 x operators on a single mast) were to transmit at full power 24hrs a day, that would reach less the 2% of the required radiation to impact human cells. See the ICNIRP report for details.\nThis is why the Antennas are often mounted further away/higher on the structure. \n\nSource: my teams design and deploy 4G/5G technologies across the UK.
