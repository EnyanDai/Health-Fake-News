I've spoken to people who claimed chemotherapy kills more than it helps (vitally offensive to me as a survivor) - I've seen people who are actively doubting the pandemic, even as obituaries are being brought to them as proof. It makes me *ANGRY*, and anger is not in my nature.\n\nBut my anger is not productive if I just take it out on these people with insults or trying to harm them - that has no positive effect. It may feel good to ME but it is not what's best or what's right.\n\nThe main emotion I tend to feel for these people is SADNESS. Sad because I know many of them will never snap out of it. And because most of them are better than that, but they're being misled, their minds clouded, and frankly they're being controlled and manipulated but refuse to acknowledge or accept that.\n\nDo I know the answer though?
