Life can be unfair. Last time I checked I was not born into a rich family of models. I imagine the people born into poverty would also think it was not people causing their strife.  Pretty sure people who got cancer don't think it's very fair, and that is life. \n\nWhen people say life is not fair, they mean that the situation is under no one's control.\n\nA person can be unfair or they can be fair. Do you really think the person stealing you stuff is always being unfair? In their mind they got screwed by life or society. They can't afford things and they need to survive. It's certainly not fair that they need to have 3 jobs while they person they steal from has a single job. It's also not fair the person with 3 jobs simply does not have the opportunities of others.  You could say it's society and people control that, but in reality people don't control their genetics or where they are born.\n\nSure you have people who steal for fun or when it's not a life or death situation. Those people are being unfair.\n\nYou also have people giving to charities because they have so much. That is them trying to be fair.\n\nGeneralizing things sounds great, but it's not reality which is way more nuanced.", "created_utc": 1586950825.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngzv5o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngu4jw", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngzv5o", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngzv5o/"}
