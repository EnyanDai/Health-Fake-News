People were busy laughing at China in the beginning. When China locked down the cities, people were laughing; when China started to build temporary hospitals, people were laughing. No government in Europe started to seriously prepare for the possible outbreak in their own country. \n\nNow that the virus has arrived. People started to criticize the inaction of China instead of their own government. Look at the neighbors of China, South Korea controlled the situation within one or two weeks, while Taiwan and Japan did not have large outbreak at all. No matter what China has done or has not done, it is possible to stop the virus and prevent large casualty. But so many western countries failed, and I am sure blaming China will not make the situation any better.", "created_utc": 1585693138.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm29lnt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fs11kb", "parent_id": "t1_fm20lb8", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm29lnt", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China/comments/fs11kb/the_coronavirus_is_becoming_a_public_relations/fm29lnt/"}
