You are using a device that requires these \"harmful\" frequencies. Of you really think that the transmissions are so harmful, then stop using any cellular device or computer. \n\nYou say that we were getting along fine 100 years ago without any technology. Guess what dipshit, millions of people died 100 years ago because of diseases that we can now prevent. Vaccines are different from drugs. They have been tested and scientifically proven to be helpful. People a lot smarter than you have worked to save lives.\n\nI think vaccines should be mandatory, as long as they have been proven to be benficial. Why should parents have the right to put their childrens lives at risk. They are not taking the choice for themselves, they are taking it for someone else. There is a difference between illegal drugs and vaccines.", "created_utc": 1586186930.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmli877", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmkhggu", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmli877", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmli877/"}
