There are other perspectives that are reasonable in their criticisms.  You people do realize there is practically no research done for the effects of 5G?  There are studies that show relation to cellular radiation and tumors, and then there are other studies that claim there is not substantial evidence.  I cannot speak to the integrity of all experiments, but I do know there are not studies for 5G that provide meaningful data sufficient in concluding safety. \n\nThis is not a technology we should be blindly implementing.   Seeing all these articles sowes skepticism for what are actually valid concerns, being the request that this technology is proven safe before implemented.  A technology like this could have affects on fertility, I am very surprised there aren't more reasonable comments being skeptical of 5G.  I do understand though, because you're only being presented with potentially unreasonable attacks on 5G, but I implore you to consider reasonable criticism against implementing this technology when there is no meaningful scientific data to show it is safe.
