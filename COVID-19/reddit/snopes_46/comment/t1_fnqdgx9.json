And, like nearly every paper ever, they end with \"more research is needed\", which sounds scary. \n\nYou can kinda see why \"zomg they're melting our membranes!\" is a resonant (ha) meme, since it's much more complex and much harder to disprove than the ionisation or heating arguments of yesteryear, which can each be dismissed by trivial physics.\n\nIt seems a bit like noticing that people's pupils contract in light and therefore organising to burn down lamp posts.
