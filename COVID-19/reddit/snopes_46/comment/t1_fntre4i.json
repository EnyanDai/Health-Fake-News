I was not familiar enough with 5G tech so I did look it up. But you are wrong too:\n\nDriven by wireless carrier marketing, many people have become confused and think that 5G is synonymous with millimeter-wave, a very short-range, high-speed frequency band. mmWave 5G promises multi-gigabit speeds, but has trouble penetrating walls and traveling long distances. AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon will all use at least some mmWave, in some cities. For what it's worth, because it's a shorter range technology, mmWave base stations are actually lower-power than traditional macro-cell sites.\n\nBut mmWave isn't necessary for 5G. AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile all plan to install 5G on existing 4G frequencies such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz. On those frequencies, 5G uses the same towers as 4G, and has the same distance and wall-penetration characteristics as existing 4G networks, but with lower latency and at least 35 percent greater speed. T-Mobile is counting on 600MHz to cover rural areas.\n\nIn the case of COVID-19 and the installation of 5th Generation cell data towers, they are completely separate things. South Korea has had 5G for quite a while now. Why hadn\u2019t symptoms of COVID started there last year?\n\nThe first fairly substantial deployments were in April 2019. In South Korea, SK Telecom claimed 38,000 base stations, KT Corporation 30,000 and LG U Plus 18,000; of which 85% are in six major cities.[43] They are using 3.5 GHz (sub-6) spectrum in non-standalone (NSA) mode and tested speeds were from 193 to 430 Mbit/s down.[44] 260,000 signed up in the first month and 4.7 million by the end of 2019.[45]", "created_utc": 1587247257.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fntre4i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fntpxg6", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fntre4i", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fntre4i/"}
