Our brains and social traditions for thousands of years have operated in a way where social validation was a rough proxy for decent ideas. It has never been perfect (plenty of shitty ideas have had swells in popularity at times), but in the long term it has been at least \"okay\", especially after we developed a way to establish more trusted authorities.\n\nHowever, now almost anyone can find that validation for almost any idea. There could be 100 people on the entire planet that think some crazy thing...and all 100 of them can find each other online and reinforce their madness. This has also had the secondary effect of attacking the credibility of our trusted authority sources, creating feedback loops/echo chambers that are literally breaking apart our collective sanity.\n\nI think there is a very real chance that social media destroys democracy in all but name unless we find a solution. We are getting close to wide-spread boycotting of established education sources. That is terrifying as it will amplify the problem significantly. Once crazy establishes long-term control, all of civilization's work thus far is in severe jeopardy. It feels like we're nearing that point due to leaders who have gained power recently like those in the US, Brazil, UK, Australia, Philippines etc...", "created_utc": 1588892961.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptkit0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt5nxj", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptkit0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptkit0/"}
