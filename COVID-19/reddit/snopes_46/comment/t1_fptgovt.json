I am a cell tower technician currently but I took my wind turbine experience to this industry.  There is a trade school in WA,USA called Northwest Renewable Energy Institute (NW-REI) where I schooled for 6 months about wind turbines. This is where you want to go. I used my dad's military to pay for the school but I'm sure it's not expensive. They have their own apartment complex for students which is shared by a hospitality school (so a bunch of girls also stay at that complex too, hehe) It was probably the best 6 months of my life and I highly recommend it.\n      The staff is awesome and really engaging. Definitely look up the school if you're interested. Trust me the experience you gain in 6 months can carry you far into the trade world as it teaches you; Hydraulics, electrical, rigging, climbing, and how to write out and execute PLC systems.
