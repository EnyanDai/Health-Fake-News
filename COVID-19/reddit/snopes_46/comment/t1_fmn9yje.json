Having [their babies taken from them for years](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2019/aug/24/family-separation-immigration-kids-mental-health-trump). With mass incidents of [child sexual abuse](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/us/immigrant-children-sexual-abuse.html). \n\nUyghurs who were supporting extremist terrorist cells that were literally sending teams across [China and hacking hundreds of people with knives and killing dozens in railway stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Kunming_attack). \n\nLet's face it both institutions are probably incarcerating a whole load of innocents, for political reasons. Both have mix of support and opposition from their host populations. And both are reprehensible. Hard to compare death rates. Since China doesn't publish those. [Found an article from mid 2019 claiming 24 had died in ICE custody since Trump came to power](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/24-immigrants-have-died-ice-custody-during-trump-administration-n1015291)\n\nAlso from my last half hour of research, seems China has different camps for different purposes. Some are for more hardened types who may have actually gone off to receive training in places like Afghanistan I found an article that claimed [150-200 had died in a 6 month period in no1. camp in Kuchar county](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/deaths-10292019181322.html) [which at the time was a camp of 6000 people for more extremist types](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/kuchar-08092018124248.html), others are more like forcing people to learn Mandarin. So probably less opportunity to die in interrogation. Haven't yet found any data on these basic reeducation camps yet. Obviously this is also a form of cultural genocide, comparable to what Canada and Australia were doing to their native populations throughout most of the last century. \n\nProbably more reasonable to compare the Chinese camps for people who were planning violence to US camps around the world for people doing the same thing. \n\nI'm not in favor of any of this.
