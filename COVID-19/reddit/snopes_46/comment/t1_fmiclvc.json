The whole 5G conspiracy theory was potentially made to take away from real conspiracy theories, like how this was started in a biomedical facility in Wuhan to suppress/disrupt the Hong Kong protests, and the diseases' impact is setting the stage for the 1% to outlast everyone else and buy everything back when we're all dead. This is a symptom of the class war, that millions of average Americans are losing jobs and don't have the savings accounts to weather the storm, but now rich people can hole up in their houses and be fine. This coronavirus disproportionately affects low income families/people the most, and the healthcare costs that come with it are devastating too. Meanwhile the US government is arguing over pennies and nickels because the GOP truly does not want to give out stimulus packages to anyone but the corporations, because if they still believe the trickle down effect works, then they'll have lobbyists and \"campaign donations\" for life.", "created_utc": 1586106902.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmiclvc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "parent_id": "t3_fuy9mr", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjnq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmiclvc", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/TechNewsToday/comments/fuy9mr/no_5g_didnt_cause_the_coronavirus_pandemic/fmiclvc/"}
