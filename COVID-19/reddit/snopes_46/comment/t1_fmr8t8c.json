Like used it for everything short of flushing the toilet and drank a gallon a day. Rubbed it on her skin instead of lotion. Used in place of soap, kitchen cleaner and shampoo. Made coffee, pasta, literally any and all water that was going into or near her body had to be alkaline water. pH 10, although she also order bottles of it that claimed to be 11 online for \"when she was sick.\" Over 6 months she had increasingly severe digestive problems until she took herself to a doctor who suggested that she stop drinking the alkaline water... Within a couple of problems abated.\n\nIt took her years to admit that it was the alkaline water. She still uses it to make coffee and few other things but no longer drinks it and cautions anyone against doing so.", "created_utc": 1586316628.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmr8t8c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwkcwo", "parent_id": "t1_fmq94ea", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmr8t8c", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwkcwo/youtube_tightens_rules_after_david_icke_5g/fmr8t8c/"}
