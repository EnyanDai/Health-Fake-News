The space occupied by China has been home to thousands of cultures over that time period. Not just ones that have risen and fallen in that time, but also ones which exist even today. And even if we were to draw a strict line in the sand and call Han Chinese culture the truest form of Chinese culture, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to be able to say that over the centuries even that culture has remained consistent. There is very little that modern Chinese culture has in common with where things were 3000 years ago, and very little in common between the culture of someone living out in the rural west with the life of someone living in Beijing, or hell, Taiwan even.\n\nThe point being, the kind of monolithic and singular culture that you\u2019re trying to propose simply doesn\u2019t exist. There is no such thing. What does exist, and which is usually meant when people say \u201cwestern culture\u201d is a shared and interlinked group of ideas, symbols and values that originate from a common heritage. And whilst that is a very abstract group of things, it absolutely exists. It\u2019s what produced the specific set of philosophical outlooks we have today, and is also the reason why in art, the nightingale which appears in Ovid can appear in Berkeley Square millennia later and still represent roughly the same thing.", "created_utc": 1586029535.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmfl572", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_furdeu", "parent_id": "t1_fmfh6v9", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmfl572", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/furdeu/masts_set_on_fire_over_false_5g_coronavirus_claims/fmfl572/"}
