Claimed that Wuhan was where 5G was invented, claimed that no one was dying of the virus (\"seriously, does anyone actually know anyone who has died? Nobody knows anyone who has died!\" this was when the crisis had just hit the UK), claimed that \"5G towers will microwave you alive from the inside out\". I speak Chinese and live in China, he could have reached out to me for the inside scoop if he'd have wanted! I could've informed him that 5G has been available in Korea for over a year already, so far 0 cases of human beings being cooked alive from the inside out. I could have told him of my wife's auntie who died from Corona-related pneumonia in South East Asia, or my wife's cousin who is a doctor in California and is currently wracked with guilt because her father just died from Corona-related pneumonia that she is convinced she passed on to him (despite strictly following procedure).\n\nIt just goes to show the mentality of these people. This is a person who could have reached out with a phone call and spoken to me - someone who was in Hubei province on business just last year, who has been to Korea and seen friends using 5G, who has had deaths already in my extended family. But no, he's happier to do his \"research\" by thoughtlessly imbibing a river of bullshit from Youtube and Twitter. Always boasting about how he has \"researched\" things, yet he had a direct line to someone who could've cleared up a lot of these questions for him yet it didn't even occur to him to take this opportunity.", "created_utc": 1585881926.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fma23je", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ftsgvk", "parent_id": "t1_fm8v9c2", "score": 22, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fma23je", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/ftsgvk/uk_media_outlets_told_not_to_promote_baseless_5g/fma23je/"}
