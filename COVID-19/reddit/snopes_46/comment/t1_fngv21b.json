That intuitive part of your brain that is supposed to kick in when your are presented with new information that clashes dramatically with other information you have previously received seems to be nearly absent in a portion of the population. Similarly, internalizing concepts like automatically ranking sources by trustworthiness of competence (Ex: Facebook post vs blog vs college professor blog vs university paper vs paper published in scientific journal specialized in that area of subject matter) are also lacking. In truth someone with fairly low intelligence but a reasonable grasp of the above concepts alongside the numerous other areas of wisdom would never fall for these kinds of ridiculous conspiracy theories.\n\nAs an aside this is also why you occasionally see people on here talking about how X person is \u201cthe smartest person they know\u201d yet they have bought into some conspiracy theory or bad bit of propaganda. They are smart enough to see the connections being presented to them, but they aren\u2019t wise enough to be able to filter the information they are internalizing.", "created_utc": 1586946034.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngv21b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngjab9", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngv21b", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngv21b/"}
