I lived in a pretty nice area growing up and we still had people who just didn\u2019t care in school. \n\nB.) even if someone is well educated you can\u2019t stop them from picking up these sort of things online etc.\n\nSo let\u2019s say there\u2019s no suppression of this stuff, what\u2019s to stop people from deciding that they want to believe in it?  While the arguments are nonsensical they are made in a way that can be seen as believable to people who are more prone to that sort of thing or who don\u2019t understand modern technology and therefore are susceptible to believe things that others might not.\n\nI guess my point is that it\u2019s easy to look on the outside and \u201cfix the problem\u201d but it\u2019s so much more deeper than just providing a \u201cbetter\u201d education.  It\u2019s a complete failure in society as a whole.
