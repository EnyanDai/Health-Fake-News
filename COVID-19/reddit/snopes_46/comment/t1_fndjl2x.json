I can go point at engine components laid out a table and my girlfriend still isn't going to understand how the whole thing put back together works. Electronics are even more complicated than internal combustion engines, require specialized knowledge, and laypeople will still believe whatever they want. The people who unders how the technology works in general terms aren't worried enough to need to see internals and components to stay unconcerned. Ignorant people said the same things out of fear regarding 3g, 4g, wifi, cell phones in general, and they all ended up being wrong. They're all surrounded by EM waves every second of the day unless they go out into rural areas in certain states. I can drive west from Dallas all the way out to El Paso and not lose cell service. I haven't gone anywhere in 10 years at least where my phone didn't work. Even my friend's hunting least which is an hour off the highway out in the woods down a gravel road has cell service. This misinformation is coming from people who have a stake in current technology and don't want things to progress. Not many companies make the receivers/transmitters, and they don't want their products to be switched out. They put out bullshit propaganda and then laymen spread it, misinterpret and spread some more.", "created_utc": 1586871488.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fndjl2x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g0rx6e", "parent_id": "t1_fndhzob", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fndjl2x", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/g0rx6e/5g_tower_fire_in_italy_during_coronavirus_lockdown/fndjl2x/"}
