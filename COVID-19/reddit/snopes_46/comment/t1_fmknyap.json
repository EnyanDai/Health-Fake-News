Children have an instinct to listen to their parents teachings and have no real critical thinking skills yet, and old people are just too set in their thinking to really question their underlying validity but adults that expect to be taken seriously that still believe in silly nonsense is another deal.  \nI recall being more careful in my youth as much of my family was religious and attending a private christian boarding school it did me no favours among the faculty being a salty atheist.    \nMy \"official\" position was more along the lines of agnosticism but when you put any real thougth into it religion is pretty much as stupid as flat earthism, antivaxxers and 5g networks causes coronavirus. Its cute in a ignorant way but when it affects innocent people through violence, laws, moralism and secondary effects i tend to get more militant about it.   \nPeople treat other people as shit already, religion is just another way to justify treating more people even shittier.    \n The \"holierthanthou\" im so kind and virtuous as a religious person rubs me the wrong way as it implies that people cant be kind without having a virtual gun to their neck. ( i mean, they are literally commanded to be nice to people at the threat of eternal damnation and torture, how is that supposed to make their apparent benign behaviour not become totally facetious?)   The irony that they claim that their religion makes people kinder and altruistic, implying that people without religion are less kind is lost on them.", "created_utc": 1586161786.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmknyap", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmj4aqn", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmknyap", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmknyap/"}
