I think he's more intelligent than Fury, although he's definitely less charismatic and witty. \n\nThurman is almost certainly going to be a commentator when he retires, reminds me a lot of Andre Ward, lots of great insight, and can view things objectively.", "created_utc": 1586065161.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmh32gf", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_fv4hmg", "parent_id": "t1_fmgzu7r", "score": -9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj0l", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmh32gf", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/Boxing/comments/fv4hmg/amir_khan_explains_wild_conspiracy_theory_linking/fmh32gf/"}
