During experiments with 60 GHz frequencies, researchers found that over 90% of the power transmitted through the wavelengths receive absorption as far down as the dermis layer of the skin. This stimulus can be damaging enough that it causes physical pain in some individuals. Constant exposure to it may also increase the risk of cancer development and various skin diseases.\n\nWhen the skin is unable to protect the body from this invisible intrusion, we lose many of the benefits it provides. Healthy skin works like a solid brick wall, offering bio-lipids that cooperate to form \u201cmortar\u201d that keeps this organ healthy. Issues with pH balance, hormonal imbalance, and moisture retention are all possible outcomes due to 5G exposure.\n\nBecause your sweat glands will essentially act as a set of antennas for these new frequencies, the impact due to its constant exposure could create additional wellness risks for people who are usually healthy.\n\nThe human body has between two million to four million sweat ducts. Dr. Ben-Ishai of Hebrew University, Israel explains that our sweatducts act like \u201can array of helical antennas when exposed to these wavelengths,\u201d meaning that we becomemore conductive. A recent New York study which experimented with 60GHz waves stated that \u201cthe analysesof penetration depth show that more than 90% of the transmitted power is absorbed in the epidermis anddermis layer.\u201d\n\nThe effects of MMWs as [studied by Dr. Yael Stein](https://ehtrust.org/letter-fcc-dr-yael-stein-md-opposition-5g-spectrum-frontiers/) of Hebrew University is said to also cause humansphysical painas our nociceptors flare up in recognition of the wave as a damaging stimuli. So we\u2019re lookingat possibilities of many skin diseases and cancer as well as physical pain to our skin.\n\nDefinitely something we might want to spend more time looking into before deploying at scale.", "created_utc": 1586928718.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fngd84b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fngceaa", "score": -27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fngd84b", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fngd84b/"}
