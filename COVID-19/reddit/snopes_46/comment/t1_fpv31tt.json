I also admit it's a simplified scientific process for the sake of an example. \n\nScience doesn't limit its conclusions to falsifying hypotheses. If we reinforce a hypothesis, then we keep it, but we will never say the hypothesis is absolutely true. Though, on the contrary, if we disprove a hypothesis, we are comfortable in saying it's absolutely false. Ultimately, science seeks objective truths, and the only real way to do this is to falsify hypotheses, because reinforcing a hypothesis doesn't produce an objective truth. \n\nBut Its also about experimental design. Designing an experiment that tries to falsify a hypothesis is a better experiment than one that attempts to reinforce a hypothesis. In fact, I would say if one is designing experiments that tries to reinforce their hypothesis, then they are doing terrible science.\n\nThis is why the primary basis of a scientific hypothesis is that it's falsifiable. A hypothesis that is not falsifiable cannot be taken through a healthy scientific process. As a result, most scientists tend to dodge questions like \"does god exist? \". Both obvious hypotheses, \"god exists\" and \"god does not exist\", are very difficult to disprove if not impossible to disprove. This issue exists due to the intangible concept of \"god\". As a result, we leave that discussion to other philosophical fields where this limitation of a falsifiable hypothesis is not a requirement.", "created_utc": 1588933102.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpv31tt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpuik9z", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1588934011.0, "name": "t1_fpv31tt", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fpv31tt/"}
