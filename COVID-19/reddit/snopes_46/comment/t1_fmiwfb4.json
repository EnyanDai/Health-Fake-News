We _created_ most of that shit or were there when it became available to our geeky younger selves. We _had_ to understand it in order to use it, because, frankly said, it was _not easy to use_.\n\n(Most) Older folks did not want to learn then and certainly don't want to learn now, so they simply avoid these \"new\" technologies. Some colleagues of mine use applications from the last _millenium_ because their manual says so and they don't know _why_ they're doing it anyway.\n\n(Most) Younger people treat it like magic. As long as something just works ^TM they'll use it. If it breaks they don't know any of the underlying principles to help themselves. My boss's teenager kids come to me if they forget their fucking Instagram password because they are too dumb to reset it!\n\nWhat both of the latter groups are missing is a healthy curiosity. The times when a wrong command could fry your hardware are long gone (it's still possible, but magnitudes harder to really do). People in all age groups just have to be willing to _learn_. This includes not only technology but every aspect of modern life.\n\nOf course there are exemptions in all groups...", "created_utc": 1586118285.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmiwfb4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmi8tt5", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmiwfb4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmiwfb4/"}
