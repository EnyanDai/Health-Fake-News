There's no need to be afraid of losing your first amendment rights, since there is no evidence that the US government is planning to limit those. Any argument that claims that this will set a precendent is a slippery slope argument; since when does the US government take advice from Youtube on how to write its censorship policies? Second of all, I think its an excellent idea. If people were smart enough to decide for themselves what is true from what is crap, this wouldn't be an issue! Engineers wouldn't be be recieving death threats and phone masts wouldn't be  set on fire.

They just believe the very first idea that they read and are so afraid of being wrong that they cling to it regardless of opposing evidence.
