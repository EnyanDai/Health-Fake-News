Fuck Bill Gates, fuck Value-Added models, fuck billionaires who think money gives them some sort of right to inject themselves into others' lives.\n\nWe don't need to have a struggle session every time this topic comes up, but Bill Gates spending his money this way doesn't make him a good person nor does it compensate for the bad that he has brought to this world.", "created_utc": 1589894059.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fr4pbji", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gmhezr", "parent_id": "t1_fr43mco", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fr4pbji", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gmhezr/australian_poll_finds_1_in_8_blame_bill_gates_and/fr4pbji/"}
