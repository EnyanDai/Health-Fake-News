Titers can be checked with a blood sample. This can show your immunity to certain diseases, whether you've been vaccinated for it, have immunity from catching a wild strain of the disease, etc...\n\nWell this is close to knowledge.  You are confusing \"titers\" for a titer test, the concentration of a solution as determined by titration. A titer test is a measure of antibodies in the blood, providing a check of disease immunity. The results of a titer test then allow a clinician to determine whether a vaccination is required.\n\nYes the technology exists and is being used.  My children got chicken pox, I wasn't sure if I had received the chicken pox vaccine or if I had caught it as a child.  Since chicken pox is more dangerous for adults they tested for varicella zoster virus antibodies.  I had the antibodies, so I didn't have to get a vaccination for it.\n\nHowever keep believing your cock fantasy, we all need something to give us meaning in this meaningless existence.", "created_utc": 1586275756.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmp7abs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvu8ql", "parent_id": "t1_fmm9w20", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2yrq6", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmp7abs", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/PublicFreakout/comments/fvu8ql/british_5g_towers_are_being_set_on_fire_because/fmp7abs/"}
