What I had to face up to is that the way I tended to go about it - that is, in a confrontational manner, was probably more likely to push someone away than convince them that I had a valid point of view. \n\nIn order to help someone, in order to reach them, you first have to show that you understand the way they think, their feelings and their wants and needs. This is a very common practice in therapy and counselling for that reason. If we can understand the role religion is playing in their life then we can understand how to talk to them about what would replace it, and that they need not fear. I think I see religious people more as victims now rather than valid subjects of ridicule, even though I believe we should strongly criticise and sometimes mock religion as a whole and as a concept. \n\nThat said, I understand the cynicism.
