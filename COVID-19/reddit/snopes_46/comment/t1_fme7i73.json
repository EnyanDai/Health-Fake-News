It is simply the way it is. The description of how Judges behave is simply the way it is. The change it drives in society is simply the way it is. It's not all about you. It is relevant because Rachel Riley has taken legal action against people for behaviour that is similar to the behaviour of \"an obvious edit\". So it really is relevant. Why is one person (whomsoever they are) entitled to make \"an obvious edit\" and another person gets sued for libel? You might think I am avoiding saying something. I am. You have to read about the trial to discover what and why that thing is also \"an obvious edit\".\n\nOh - are you absolutely sure it is an obvious edit?\n\n> This is just waffle sorry.\n\nNo it is not. But it is the bit that is most likely to be called waffle. Because it actually - rightly or wrongly - draws a conclusion. Which might be wrong but it is a conclusion. I am not saying it *opens the door* to a dumbed down society. I am saying it *enforces* a dumbed down society.\n\nWhy engage with critical thinking or drawing conclusions if you get sued for libel?", "created_utc": 1585992665.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fme7i73", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuetsu", "parent_id": "t1_fme6xis", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fme7i73", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fuetsu/broadband_engineers_threatened_due_to_5g/fme7i73/"}
