Was keeping an eye on their websites, forums, seeing how they brag about fooling around \"stupid, coward, snowflake girly\" westerns, how they irrationally hate 'americans' and europeans, I see all their motives, character, lie, hypocrisy and amorality from bottom to top, from simple people to ones close to influential politicians.\nAnd this is the thing that you guys can't understand and imagine without living there for a while - irrationality, irrationality of their hate, desire to humiliate, it is more prevalent than greed, they are willing to do shit to others even if they are not getting much benefit to them, humiliating others is the value by itself for them, source of their self esteem, pride. this is significant part of their mentality - 'strength above everything', 'stronger is right', so they will respect any piece of shit - murdered, pedo, pervert as long as it has power and use power to humiliate people...\n\nNot all of them but quite a lot, and of-course, here - you'll see quite different people among educated, people who managed to emigrate to US etc. But majority is more or less like I've described.\n\n\nThere is old folklore anecdote about them:\n\nOnce one of saints appeared in front of a villager and said: I will fulfill one wish.
