In thousands of studies of very high frequency radio signals a host of biological effects were found. From immune system to heart health. I don't think 5G towers have anything to do with Covid19, but 5G poses inherent and very real risks.\n\nEdit: People are just insulting which says it all. You should take that as a strong hint to do some research on the subject. Since when was encouraging people to study something unacceptable? I'll tell you - in the age of propaganda and social manipulation.\n\nEdit 2: \nIf you think these waves cannot do remote damage have a look at this:-\n\nhttps://www.rfsafe.com/5g-network-uses-nearly-same-frequency-as-weaponized-crowd-control-systems/\n\nHow it looks in real life:-\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pmcX_xGUQA\n\nSo it's 60-**95GHZ** for 5G and this weapon is at **95GHZ**. \n\nBut if you want to really learn about this topic this is a compilation of **more than 1600 studies on this subject** which I personally used to form my opinion:-\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/19CbWmdGTnnW1iZ9pxlxq1ssAdYl3Eur3/view\n\nIn the following article, a Scientist who actually did some of these studies writes a summary:-\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/we-have-no-reason-to-believe-5g-is-safe/\n\nI encourage you all to firstly question why facts are being downvoted and secondly to do your own research.
