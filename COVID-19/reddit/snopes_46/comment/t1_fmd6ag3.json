You're talking about deploying hundreds of thousands of small cells in very close proximity to each other and people  (mmWave has terrible penetration so you need an enormous number of cells compared to traditional LTE). \n\nAnd in the US at least there's been nothing like real testing to certify this. People are just told 'trust the experts'.\n\nSo its an experiment and you're the rats - it'll be interesting to see how it pans out.", "created_utc": 1585960269.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmd6ag3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuczaj", "parent_id": "t3_fuczaj", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585961526.0, "name": "t1_fmd6ag3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fuczaj/robert_f_kennedy_jr_posted_this_regarding_5g_and/fmd6ag3/"}
