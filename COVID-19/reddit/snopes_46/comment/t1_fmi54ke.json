I\u2019m David. ***Several years ago I read an article about the harmful effects caused by RF Radiation.*** This led me to an in-depth study of the subject. As I read the findings of many scientific studies I was flabbergasted that more people did not know about this. I bought some meters and began testing my own house and then researching ways to correct the issues I found. This website grew out of that research. Now it is one of the most trusted sources to learn about RF Radiation.\n\nHis qualifications aren't exactly filling me with confidence. \n\nIf you genuinely want to know the risks of 5G then you can always [check ICNIRP's site](https://www.icnirp.org/en/frequencies/radiofrequency/index.html)\n\n>After several decades of RF-EMF research on numerous potential health effects, ***the only substantiated effect of RF EMF exposure relevant to human health and safety is heating of exposed tissue. RF EMF fields can penetrate into the body (the higher the frequency, the lower the penetration depth) and cause vibration of charged or polar molecules inside. This results in friction and thus heat.***\n>\nThe body can accommodate a small increase in heat, in a similar way that excess body heat is dissipated when performing sporting activity. This is because the human body has a strong ability to regulate its internal temperature. However, above a certain level (referred to as the threshold) depending on the duration of exposure, RF EMF exposure and the accompanying temperature rise can provoke serious health effects, such as heatstroke and tissue damage (burns).\n\n>***Acute and long-term effects of RF EMF exposure below the thermal threshold have been studied extensively without demonstrating adverse health effects.***", "created_utc": 1586102619.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmi54ke", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmhrn4k", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmi54ke", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmi54ke/"}
