You don't understand chemistry, and beyond that you should probably know that oscillating != spinning.\n\nSo you\u2019re telling me an electromagnetic frequency would have no effect on a  covalent bond(electrical) between oxygen and IRON(a ferrous/magnetic substance) \n\nAnd in the case of oxygen being a diatomic particle, oscillating would equate to spinning. \n\n>Which study? Only one I saw that related to that topic was the Soviet one, and I couldn't get it to open.\n\nIt works just fine for me. If not, just google \u201cbiological effects of millimeter wavelengths\u201d it\u2019s the first result. \n\n>I did notice that you said something was spinning at some number of \"hertz per second\" which is a redundant unit.\n\nI have to assume my audience knows next to nothing about the subject so in order to get the point across redundancy is effective to paint a picture.
