Yes, Europe has 4 of G7 countries and yes it has a lot of countries with strong economies but...But it also has a crippling dependency on other countries. To make the matter worse, it also depends on countries whos population or political leadership doesn't share the same set of moral values with the population of most European countries. Despite depending on US for protection during the Cold War you rejected Reagans wise request to diversify your energy supplier and not to become overly dependent on USSRs oil and gas. As a result, you became so dependent on Putin to keep you warm in the winter that in 2008 and 2014 you had to bite your tongue and allow him to steal parts of Georgia and Ukraine. Your entire supply chain (just like ours) is relying on China to produce either entire products or vital parts of it. You rely on 3rd world countries for cheap labor and the only country you seem to successfully fight off your markets is the only friend with muscles you have in the world -USA. So i wouldn't call Europe a joke but its time to re-assess the reality of your situation. If Europe has any intention of having political independence and of keeping any influence on the rest of the world it needs to start diversifying its options and push China out of its infrastructure. Honestly, the world is a better place when its influenced by Europe so Europe please get your shit together!", "created_utc": 1587533934.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo5s30j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rrya", "parent_id": "t1_fo5blrv", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo5s30j", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/g5rrya/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo5s30j/"}
