Especially with the wealth of information available on the Internet. \n\nIs there really any way to have a good faith debate about things that are honestly not debatable? I think the evidence is pretty conclusive that the Earth is round and that microwave signals don't cause viruses. \n\nMy concern about \"coddling\" as I put it earlier is that if ideas like these aren't ridiculed as the outrageous bullshit that they clearly are, it allows more people to get sucked in. If you engage in a debate about something it automatically lends the other side an amount of legitimacy that ideas like these frankly don't deserve. \n\nA lot of this is just frustration on my part though, this kind of stuff gets under my skin. I can agree with attacking the idea and not the person as a more constructive approach, but I don't personally have the patience for it.  Had a guy I used to work with that didn't believe the moon landings happened.
