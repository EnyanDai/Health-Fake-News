So I think pushing them to read and educate themselves about the real issue and pointing out that when they spread this made up bullshit they are actually just taking part of the \u201dinformation warfare\u201d that is a legit concern in the current world. \n\nI think it helps that in order for them to believe in this conspiracy they have started egotripping on the feeling that they are not sheeps and they know some hidden knowledge what sheepish people don\u2019t know. So using a bit of the same language than conspiracy theorists use makes them to listen more rather than put them in an attack mode. \nI have noticed that the people who start believing easily this kind of crazy youtube videos are not very tech-savvy and have not been much on the internet before the social media boom. So also educating them on the technology side might help. \n\nI don\u2019t think all of them are stupid people, they might be just running into conspiracy theories for the first time in their internet life and lack the knowledge which would protect them from believing in this crap.", "created_utc": 1586607866.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn2ykdh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fyudtd", "parent_id": "t1_fn2cojs", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn2ykdh", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/fyudtd/coronavirus_conspiracies_like_that_bogus_5g_claim/fn2ykdh/"}
