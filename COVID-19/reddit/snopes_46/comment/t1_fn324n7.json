Everything is built on clunky frameworks that only load quickly because everybody has high speed internet which can load and cache the massive back-end libraries that make most websites function. \n\nThe whole reason for pushing forward with 5G is that the telecoms giants know that 4G won't be able to perform adequately in the not too distant future. Have you tried to load a website using 3G instead of 4G in the past few years? It takes literal minutes. This is why we have 4G instead of 3G. And it's why we're going to need 5G instead of 4G. \n\nThe alternative is to completely regulate the webdev industry to make sure that all websites are completely optimised. Given that around half of your \"web developers\" nowadays are people who drag and drop WordPress themes and don't understand optimisation in the slightest, I'd say that pushing forward with 5G is the more suitable approach.", "created_utc": 1586610845.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn324n7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fz3lm7", "parent_id": "t1_fn2yuyj", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2f3oes", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn324n7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fz3lm7/coronavirus_5g_conspiracy_theory_fuels_arson/fn324n7/"}
