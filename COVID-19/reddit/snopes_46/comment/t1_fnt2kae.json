Especially Nokia.\n\nAs well as it using millimeter waves kind of concerns me. Obviously the amperage is extremely important.\n\nBut my buddy works for Nokia and he says he himself could turn up the amperage in the towers past 80ghz. Which I don\u2019t really think they should have that ability.\n\nHe never did that but he was telling me that it was possible and at that amperage it could really cause harm to biological things with a lot of water in them.\n\n(Makes water boil like microwaves but doesn\u2019t penetrate super far just below the skin)\n\nYou can google the pain ray it\u2019s a millimeter wave crowd dispersion gun from the military.", "created_utc": 1587233393.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnt2kae", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "parent_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "score": -11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnt2kae", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/g3n9zq/no_5g_does_not_spread_coronavirus/fnt2kae/"}
