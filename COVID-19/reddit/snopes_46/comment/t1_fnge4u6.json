Lawsuits are still ongoing. We were told it was safe.\n\nWe were told diesel cars were safe. Until they weren\u2019t.\n\nJohnson and Johnson have been found guilty for their talcum powder causing cancers. Many tobacco lawsuits were only settled 15 years back.  Leaded patrol was only banned a couple of decades back at the most. We still have asbestos in many homes.\n\nOur very recent history is riddled with the deaths of millions from things we were told were ok. And large corporations claiming their products are safe. Never mind all the various drugs where side effects have been covered up. The opioid scandal is fucking disgusting.\n\nYour claim that no discussion is allowed is pretty damn pathetic.
