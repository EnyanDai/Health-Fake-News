Patient's with delirium will often exhibit a fluctuating altered level of conciousness, with psychomotor changes that aren't considered typical of dementia, and problems with attention must be present in order to make a diagnosis of delirium. Nothing stated above suggests this. \n\nThe best snap shot summary that I can provide would be to say that delirium is a change in mental state that comes on suddenly (hours to days), alters consciousness, fluctuates over 24 hours, and alters thinking and attention, resulting in changes in behavior. As I said earlier, the altered thinking or change in consciousness, and altered attention must be there. Altered thinking doesn't mean changes in long held beliefs and values, but instead refers to disorganized or inchorehent thoughts. The changes in attention present as being unable to focus, or demonstrating preservation, meaning being unable to drop focus on something. These signs and symptoms come on much more abruptly than any similar identifiers of dementia.\n\nUnlike dementia, delirium is a medical emergency, so while I agree it needs to be looked for in any at risk populations, that needs to be done with a solid understanding of the differences. I recommend some continuing education concerning distinguishing between delirium and dementia. Perhaps your institution has clinical decision support tools that you can review, in addition to any educational resources, such as an online module that discusses the distinction.", "created_utc": 1587502519.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo4dlei", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5fyvm", "parent_id": "t1_fo41fqt", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587503932.0, "name": "t1_fo4dlei", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskDocs/comments/g5fyvm/my_very_smart_dad_has_recently_started_reading/fo4dlei/"}
