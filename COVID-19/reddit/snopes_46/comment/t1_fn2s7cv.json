I think their concern lies in the mass roll out of new technology while everyone is in quarantine. There are 100's of [scientists and doctors](https://ehtrust.org/scientists-and-doctors-demand-moratorium-on-5g-warning-of-health-effects/) that are concerned about the health effects of this technology. I think the conflation of COVID with 5G is a red herring.\n\n>\u201cWe, the undersigned, more than 180 scientists and doctors from 35  nations, recommend a moratorium on the roll-out of the fifth generation,  5G, for telecommunication until potential hazards for human health and  the environment have been fully investigated by scientists independent  from industry.\u201d\n\nEDIT: List of Doctors and Scientists from just the US (I swear Reddit lacks basic critical thinking skills.
