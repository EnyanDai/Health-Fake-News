It seems like people keep saying 5G is safe because EM radiation isn't concentrated, but isn't the whole point of the current implementation of 5G to be sending out individual beams of mmw radiation directly *at* people?\n\nIf 4G signals frequently resonate to produce 5G waves, won't 5G waves resonate to produce higher energy waves? Won't the density of the towers compound this? If enough local towers are synchronized and directed at one location, would we see the kind of thermal effects observed in military applications of EM radiation?\n\nAre you familiar with the research that shows a significant difference in the effects of localized versus general radiation of particular wavelengths? Even at the same intensity, waves that are directed at specific areas of the body produce effects that aren't observed when the entire body is subject to the waves?\n\nHas there been extended medical trials with significant sample sizes to prove the safety of information-dense, 60GHz beams, or are they declared safe solely on a theoretical basis?
