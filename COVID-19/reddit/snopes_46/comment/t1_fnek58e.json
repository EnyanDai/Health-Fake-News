That's my point. Lots of people would use an implant for convenience or cashless societies. India has some pretty advanced rfid chips with medical data, body hackers are having fun with implanting themselves. Gates has proposed using the invisible ink to track vaccinations, and mentioned using it for a South Korean style testing and tracking system for the pandemic.\n\nNow how do we get from there to everyone is going to be forcibly implanted with a chip for dictatorial control or forced sterilisation against people's will? And half those people pushing the theory originally believe that marks the apocalypse and if you get the chip you go to hell and then Jesus comes back.\n\nJust saying let's stick with the facts not make tenuous connections. I can totally see the convenience of implants and biometrics being offered and people willingly taking it in times of peace because it'll be marketed for convenience and saving lives. The US government has used every new piece of technology to spy on people and win the information war since the OSS was founded. Its a given they'll hungrily swallow up that data too. The police state has been a slow creeping reality for decades and its never forced on us, its sold to us. If we were all going to be lined up and forcibly injected Gates wouldn't be advertising the fact.\n\nAlso 5g as a virus vector is so dumb. Mosquitoes are a good virus vector. Cell signals?
