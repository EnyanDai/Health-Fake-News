It's not up to someone to prove something doesn't exist.  \n\n> It is not a misrepresentation of our current knowledge. We well understand the effects of most EMF exposure and the risks, however MMW EMF on this large a scale is not well understood.  \n\n\nWe also know that sticking your hand into a fire *effects* the cells. Does that mean sitting beside a campfire long enough will kill you? No. It's up to someone to prove that doing so will harm us. Until then, all that exists are experiments that suggest that 5G *effects* us, yet the science has still yet to prove negative effects, especially at the cellular level.", "created_utc": 1586356977.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmsjzvg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmpmh1b", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmsjzvg", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmsjzvg/"}
