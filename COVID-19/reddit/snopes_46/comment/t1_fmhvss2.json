They are in favour of stuff like higher taxes for the rich, exposing tax evasion/avoidance, support networks for homeless/ethnic minorities/gays etc. Many of the columnists write about supporting the lower class with stuff like universal income.\n\nSure, you could certainly argue that they are in favour of stronger regulation within a capitalist system. But I think the majority of the writers often put a \"socialist spin\" on stories, without necessarily being communist or fully socialist.\n\nI'm not sure I remember them attacking Corbyn, but they frequently attack conservative leaders/big corporations and so on. During the last general election they were firmly in Labour's camp, as opposed to papers like The Telegraph, and tabloids like The Mail and The Sun.\n\nSo as a whole, maybe you're right in saying they are not exactly \"anti-capitalist\", but they're without doubt one of the papers that are most in favour of socialist ideologies.", "created_utc": 1586095107.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmhvss2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvbuuk", "parent_id": "t1_fmhun9v", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmhvss2", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvbuuk/people_across_the_uk_are_apparently_burning/fmhvss2/"}
