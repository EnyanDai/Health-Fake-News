Gov made rules and companies are abiding. that doesn't say its healthy when you scale it up with billions of devices and cell towers.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15352175/\n\nif we are talking about holding a phone next to your head, there's a really good study on that, I'll post it here when I find it. it shows that in adults, after only 5 minutes of cellphone use there is a strong reduction of blood flow directly at the position of where the cellphone was positioned. the longer the exposure the less bloodflow, which can lead to blood clots, and more heat was detected, for longer periods. cell phones were designed for adults, for kids this effect is even more dramatic. this is not good for your head. imagine being on a mobile phone for hours. this literally cooks your brain and affects protein folding and resulting structures which raises the chance of \"misfolding\". we all know what that leads to.\n\nIn the early days of radio transmission in the Netherlands, we utilized boats at sea to do broadcasts. people working on those boats reported that when it was cold they would stand in front of the transmitter to warm up. a not so nice side effect: they became infertile.\n\nwant to know more facts?
