Because as people get richer and as infant mortality rates drop, people have less children.\n\nBut then these Qultists deliberately misinterpret that to mean \"Bill Gates wants to spread vaccines to eliminate undesirable people, he even admitted it!\". Which I mean.... you really just have to think about this theory for like 6 seconds before you realize how stupid it is. Bill Gates gets up on a stage and publicly tells millions of people that he wants to reduce the earth's population, and then a few years later he personally releases a plague on humanity and hopes everyone forgot about his TED talk? How incompetent do you think Bill Gates is? If Bill Gates *wanted* to depopulate the earth using nefarious means, he surely wouldn't be so inept at it", "created_utc": 1588900772.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptydac", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fptl1yh", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptydac", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptydac/"}
