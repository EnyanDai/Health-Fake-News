Even a shit microwave is 700W. 5G antennae would typically be 250mW, so something like 0.025W (might actually be another zero or two after the decimal, but I'm fairly sure I got it right). (EDIT: I was tired, and forgot my super-simple metric. Duhhh me. It's 0.25W, as was  helpfully pointed out. I'm ashamed of myself, because that was like year 2 maths)\n\nIn contrast, the lightbulbs we were using from god knows when until the mid 2000's were usually either 60W or 100W, and yes. Lightbulbs emit EM radiation too. A 700W lightbulb would definitely cook something or other. My halogen oven uses pretty much that exact principle.\n\nSo sure, the mast might fry you, but you'd die of old age a few centuries before you got anywhere near rare. And that's from being right there in front of it. Further away, less of a risk.\n\nThe especially fun part is that the lightbulb is actually nearer to the dangerous end of the EM spectrum (UV, Gamma, Xray) than the cell tower.", "created_utc": 1587011951.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnk12j3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1u6wr", "parent_id": "t1_fniuf8j", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587054911.0, "name": "t1_fnk12j3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/g1u6wr/vandals_set_50_cellphone_masts_in_the_uk_on_fire/fnk12j3/"}
