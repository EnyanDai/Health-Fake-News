So that they can hide away from society or *anywhere* a 5g connection is possible?\n\nLook, the argument I was dissecting was idiotic in the first place. I would rather debate the science as that's what's really at the core of the issue.\n\nThe 'evidence' you speak of is bullshit. Anything ranging from radio waves to visible light are considered non-ionizing and wont cause harm. Even with ionizing radiation, it takes significant doses to cause any actual damage.\n\nOn top of that, 5G mostly uses the same frequencies as existing mobile networks. Then, you also need to consider the actual dose being absorbed, which is a product of the power source and the distance it travels.\n\nImagine a red hot light bulb. From a few millimeters away, it might get hot enough to burn you, but move just 1 meter away and you wont feel a thing because there's an exponential drop in energy being absorbed.\n\nIf you consider the miles between you and these 5g towers, you're absorbing a *minuscule* amount of *non-ionizing* radiation. If any of this were a real problem, we would have been wiped out from the 70+ years that these frequencies have already been in use for, and at higher power levels than are being used for 5g.", "created_utc": 1586881088.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fne0wfb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g11x0r", "parent_id": "t1_fnds9tq", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_5r98w", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586881350.0, "name": "t1_fne0wfb", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/FuckYouKaren/comments/g11x0r/when_somebody_says_5g_doesnt_cause_coronavirus/fne0wfb/"}
