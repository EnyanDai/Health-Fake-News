A bunch of them never paid attention to jack shit besides which person of the opposite (or same I guess) gender was most attractive. I knew people who barely passed most of their high school classes, then went on to college to get some bullshit degree, most likely barely passing classes too. Then they go on to get a job at a decent company making decent money only because they know someone there. A ton of people get pretty far in life not knowing even the basics of any given subject. \n\nThen they go on Facebook armed with questionable sources acting like they are experts on any matter they speak on. And enough other dumbfucks don\u2019t care that\u2019s it\u2019s some unknown URL, and just eat it up.
