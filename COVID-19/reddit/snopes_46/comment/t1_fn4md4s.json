Someone I know shared a video about it from Andreas Klacker. His title is Dr but he is not a medical  doctor. He has PhD from  Florida.\n\nHe promotes chlorine dioxide, sells stuff on his website and cured himself with some 'magic' stuff.\n\nThe fact that his video is recorded in a 'lab' with microscopes on show gives him credibility.\n\nHe claims to be a bio physicist. Interesting info at the molecular level about X (aspects of 5G) and Y (aspects of disease)  but that doesn't translate to the human systemic level necessarily. Even if it does, it's only one trigger or factor, like with many diseases. \n\nWhen I had cancer I came across similar stuff. The problem is there may be some value in 'alternative' treatments but they are never subject to the gold standard of large scale, randomised control trials.", "created_utc": 1586644360.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn4md4s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fzet4v", "parent_id": "t1_fn4amfk", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2tk95", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn4md4s", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fzet4v/oc_5g_doesnt_spread_the_coronavirus/fn4md4s/"}
