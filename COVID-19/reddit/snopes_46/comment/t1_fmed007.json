In other words, motivated reasoning is the \"tendency to find arguments in favor of conclusions we want to believe to be stronger than arguments for conclusions we do not want to believe\".[1] It can lead to forming and clinging to false beliefs despite substantial evidence to the contrary. The desired outcome acts as a filter that affects evaluation of scientific evidence and of other people.[2]\n\nWhile dumb people are easier to fool, there isn't really an intelligence component to cognitive biases like this. In fact, more intelligent people are better at rationalising irrational beliefs making them even less susceptible to rational, evidence-based arguments against the positions they take.\n\nSo yeah, not surprised you know some smart people buying into this nonsense. If it was just idiots it wouldn't be as much of a problem because the blast radius of stupidity is generally far less that than of the intelligent and capable.", "created_utc": 1585999355.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmed007", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_furdeu", "parent_id": "t1_fmebort", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmed007", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/furdeu/masts_set_on_fire_over_false_5g_coronavirus_claims/fmed007/"}
