Pay attention to what is bold in the quote. Here's a link that has a list of other scholarly articles:  [https://www.radiationhealthrisks.com/scientific-studies/](https://www.radiationhealthrisks.com/scientific-studies/) \n\n\"Most lab studies done so far have supported the idea that RF waves don't have enough energy to damage DNA directly. Because of this, it\u2019s not clear how RF radiation might be able to cause cancer.\n\nA few studies have reported evidence of biological effects that could be linked to cancer, but this is still an area of research.\n\nA study by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) exposed large groups of lab rats and mice to types of RF energy used in cell phones. The animals were exposed over their entire bodies for about 9 hours a day, starting before birth and continuing for up to 2 years. The study found an increased risk of rare heart tumors called malignant schwannomas in the male rats exposed to RF radiation, as well as possible increased risks of certain types of tumors in the brain and adrenal glands. However, there was no clear increased risk among female rats or among male or female mice in the study. The male rats also lived longer than rats who were not exposed to RF radiation, for unclear reasons. Some aspects of this study make it hard to know what these results might mean for people, **but the results add evidence to the idea that RF radiation might potentially impact human health.**\"\n\nSo show your source that it can have absolutely NO EFFECT?
