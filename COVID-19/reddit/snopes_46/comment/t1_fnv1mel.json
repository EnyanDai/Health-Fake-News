There\u2019s no way they\u2019d have 5G on a ship yet, although I haven\u2019t checked to be sure.  Logistically they\u2019d have to setup some kind of satellite internet and probably wouldn\u2019t have the bandwidth to be able to benefit from 5G anyways.\n\nAlso, here in Canada I haven\u2019t heard of any places around me that are offering 5G yet, and still many are infected.\n\nThe thing that pisses me off the most, apart from all the pseudoscience is the idea that any government or power would develop something like this and intentionally (or accidentally) let it out without having any particular method of containment.  Let\u2019s look at Russia for instance.  When they had their massive Nuclear meltdown and denied to the world that it was happening, and sent in hundreds of their own people to seal it off (and die in the process), they fully understood the gravity of the situation.\n\nSo you\u2019re telling me that China, or the US or whoever created this virus, didn\u2019t bother to come up with a cure and ALSO didn\u2019t bother to take any serious preventative measures to limit the spread within their own country?\n\nChina tried to cover it up thinking it didn\u2019t exist.\n\nThe US government was too full of itself to care that it existed.\n\nThere\u2019s no way either of them could have made such a dangerous virus and not go to full lockdown the moment the risk was present.", "created_utc": 1587277318.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnv1mel", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "parent_id": "t1_fnsgwg2", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnv1mel", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/g3n9zq/no_5g_does_not_spread_coronavirus/fnv1mel/"}
