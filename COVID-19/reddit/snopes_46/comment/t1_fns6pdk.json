Like on any given topic in American politics today. Most people just do not have the time, energy or critical thinking levels to get to the grey area of the topic. Where the actual debate is. Everyone just finds it easier to agree with the black or white side of the argument. Because each side is pushing a narrative where the other side is completely wrong and \"evil\" and there's no compromise in-between. People rather change there fear and confusion into hate and join a team where a lot of other people share their opinion. The problem with that is neither side is looking to grow in their position. They are primarily focused on discrediting the opposite side, rather than proving their points.\n\nI think on a massive scale people are scared. They may not even be able to admit it to themselves but I think they are. The problem is, the dark road we are going down is because of innate human flaws. Greed, narcissism, arrogance, lack of empathy, lack of critical thinking. Its these things that are fucking us. But people don't want to admit we as a speices need major changes. They want to look at the \"teams\" and clicks and demographics of the world and find one that is not them and place all of the blame right there. And it's ridiculous and it's going to fuck us real good if we keep it up.
