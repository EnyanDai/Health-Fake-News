I mean, imagine if China really opened up and became a free country with actual rule of law and demoracy after they got rich, similar to Japan, Taiwan and S-Korea. How great would the world be with three powerhouses for democracy+freedom (US, EU, East Asia), it would pretty much really be the end of history, democracy and freedom would have won. There would be peaceful competition between democratic countries and autocratic countries would be the outsiders, doomed to fail. I think even if the chance was small it was worth to try it.\n\nBut the support should have stopped already 8-10 years ago, Xi taking over and going full dicatorship should have been the last straw to decouple from China already 5 years ago, not just after Trump started a Trade War and China basically pushed the whole world into recession and killed thousands of people with their virus.\n\nBetter late than never but China already inflicted so much damage to the world in all fields (ecological, political, economical) that it really makes one sick.", "created_utc": 1587553953.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo6bt4p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5rxpp", "parent_id": "t1_fo5u10d", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo6bt4p", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China/comments/g5rxpp/chinas_coronavirus_diplomacy_has_finally_pushed/fo6bt4p/"}
