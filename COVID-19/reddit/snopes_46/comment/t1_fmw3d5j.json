A multi-billion dollar industry relies on the existence of these viruses yet no-one can produce the a document that proves their existence using the deFacto methods that have been defined. He did not define these standards.\n\nBy having several documents, cross-referencing each other actually it's a weaker case because a single error in one of those documents brings the whole case down.\n\nDr Hamer only referenced one Doctor doing this, so I dont know how you extrapolate this to the whole of Israel, typical propaganda technique!\n\nDr Hamer actually left the existence of viruses (or not) open. He didn't observe direct evidence in his research of their existence so left it open rather than blindly trust the mainstream hypotheses. This is just one part of one of his biological laws (the beneficial role of microbes). Amazing that the bulk of his research was last century with the limited technology available at that time, it's too vast a subject to discuss here.\n\nI dont have court documents and in any case I dont speak German but there are many websites that reference this. Dr Hamers research is comprehensive and many are too lazy to actually try to debunk it.\n\nDr Hamer submitted his research to several establishments that were obliged to evaluate it, yet they refused. If it was not good science they would have easily debunked it. As with most alternative approaches to the mainstream, since they do not fit the mainstream paradigm, so they will not be acknowledged. We rely on anecdotal evidence, the Hydroxychloroquine being a good example of this.\n\nInteresting also that PCR was intended mainly for forensics and the inventor said it was not suitable for this type of diagnosis, yet here we are.", "created_utc": 1586438587.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmw3d5j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fxaxsf", "parent_id": "t1_fmvxq71", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmw3d5j", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fxaxsf/for_anyone_who_didnt_get_to_see_david_ickes_talk/fmw3d5j/"}
