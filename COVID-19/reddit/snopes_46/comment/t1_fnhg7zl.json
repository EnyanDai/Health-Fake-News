It's not up to someone to prove a negative - that's impossible. You can't prove that something doesn't exist. It's up to skeptics to do the research and prove something *does* exist, ie. higher cancer rates at 5G towers. Our current understanding of physics and cellular biology indicate that the local heating effects are the primary concern for humans, and 5G technology has been *proven* ad nauseam to not cause local heating nor cancer.  \nThe funny thing is, the first narrative for 5G conspiracy theorists was that it caused cancer. Many, many studies have now proven otherwise, and so now the narrative has switched to a few studies showing that 5G *might* cause other cellular effects. Researchers have taken in vitro cells and exposed them to relentless 5G and have noticed slight differences - mostly in cell membrane permeability - but have not proven that these effects even have negative outcomes. The reality is that *most* things will have an effect on cells if you look hard enough. If I stand next to a campfire, you'd find many different effects on my cells if studied in vitro. That science doesn't suggest standing next to a campfire is going to ignite me in flames.  \n\nBut that's exactly the conclusions that are being drawn from some extremely inconclusive studies. The reality is that negative health effects have NOT been proven to exist but conspiracy theorists either won't listen, or will move onto the next study to try and establish validity behind their theory.  \n\nEdit: Spelling", "created_utc": 1586961814.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnhg7zl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g1g8q8", "parent_id": "t1_fnhb7fg", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586962904.0, "name": "t1_fnhg7zl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g1g8q8/people_are_burning_down_5g_cell_phone_towers_over/fnhg7zl/"}
