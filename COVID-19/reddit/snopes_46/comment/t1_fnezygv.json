Smoking gun evidence? Is it a healthy way of thinking to dismiss any circumstantial evidence as irrelevant and refuse to make your own inferences or judgements? Isn't that just as stupid as believing every conspiracy theory you hear?\n\nHere's one for you: \n\nThere's a [mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theories) of [evidence](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/cia-directors-documentary-911-bush-213353) that US intelligence and gov't knew a terrorist attack was coming in the build up to 9/11. The hijackers were known to US intelligence: most of them trained to fly in the USA; almost all of them lived there for a period in 2000/01. Two of them even [lived with an FBI informant](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11627648) while they were training. Many had been members of Saudi terrorist organisations before they were recruited for 9/11. Then they bought their plane tickets *in their own names*.\n\nI could honestly go on and on with more verified circumstantial evidence that shouldn't be dismissed.\n\nAt what point do you have to acknowledge these facts as relevant to the discussion of culpability for 9/11, or do we just dismiss this information as 'bullshit' because it's not 'genuine evidence' (or, more likely, because it doesn't fit with your pre-existing belief about what happened)?", "created_utc": 1586898909.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnezygv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g13hvm", "parent_id": "t1_fndu6a5", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnezygv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/unitedkingdom/comments/g13hvm/britains_itv_under_fire_over_presenters/fnezygv/"}
