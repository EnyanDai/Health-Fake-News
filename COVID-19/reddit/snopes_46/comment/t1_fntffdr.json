Let's say 0.1% of all humans are likely to have some moderate level of paranoia, or at least prone to believing wild conspiracy theories... \n\nFor much of human history, you didn't really have much contact with people outside of your local community of a few hundred people, so its likely that those people never really encountered anyone else who was likely to agree with them, so they just kind of kept that stuff to themselves, or were talked out of it by those around them.\n\nIntroduce the internet, and now the whole world's population can communicate and share ideas. This is largely a great thing, but now these people can get in touch with each other, and their crazy theories are not only affirmed, but encouraged, and even spun up into wackier versions. There's a joke that if you put two conspiracy theorists with wildly different beliefs together at a bar, they won't try to argue each other to their side, but they'll develop a new conspiracy that makes both of their beliefs possible. Have you ever noticed how many conspiracies all seem to be able to link together?\n\nNow instead of being the lone person who thinks something crazy, they've found a community, and that sense of belonging and unified purpose drives them to act out in ways they never would have dreamed of doing on their own.", "created_utc": 1587240567.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fntffdr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3mgns", "parent_id": "t1_fns43a0", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fntffdr", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/g3mgns/arsonists_who_believe_5g_caused_coronavirus_have/fntffdr/"}
