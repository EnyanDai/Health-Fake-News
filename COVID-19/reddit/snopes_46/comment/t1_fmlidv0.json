They adjust their algorithm, dog whistle about it  (yet do not completely remove the video) and thus allow the viral censorship outrage and subsequent sharing (i.e. this very post) to do the work for them, getting the video possibly even more hits than it would have had otherwise, but through no official fault of their own since they were 'doing the right thing'\n\nIt's more than a bit counter-intuitive and a lot of disingenuous.  If you don't think this is a shrewd and hamhanded PR play, I can't help you.
