You're right - they don't. I suppose I'm upset because it doesn't seem like you're coming from a place of wanting to \"wake\" the American populace up, or improve them (of course, I could always be wrong) - it seems like you're coming from a place of genuine hatred or disgust. Which I get, you're probably livid. I'm angry ever single day about the state of my country. But I plead with you to rethink that hatred. I'm an American, after all, and I like to think that in reality we agree on many things despite our difference in nationality. Know that despite that failings of my country that there are people like me who want to be your friend and ally.
