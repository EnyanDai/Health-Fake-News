For example, people who can't get a good connection at home because of logistical reasons will now be able to get an exclusive 5G home connection that is actually fast. \n\nEmerging technologies like self driving cars need to be able to communicate with eachother instantly in order for that tech to be completely safe, and the low latency 5g brings will make that happen. \n\nMillions of people are currently sharing mobile connectivity when in large cities which is why you always have a shitty connection while in the city and 5g will fix that problem. \n\nJust because you don't use the internet while you are out doesn't mean nobody does.
