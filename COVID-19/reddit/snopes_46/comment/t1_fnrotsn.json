You then have emergency services and government infrastructure all relying on the same networks to carry out day to dat functions. If you then have a possible foreign adversary in charge of the updates and security of that network it can be highly problematic. People are highly dependent on mobile com's right now. During an emergency, if people cannot contact loved ones they start making irrational impulse decisions (driving like a crazy person to get home to the spouse / children). \n\nReading your comment again, its become evident you likely understand the above and don't need prompting. I will leave it in place anyhow, as people invariably equate the problem with 'well google spies on everyone anyway'.", "created_utc": 1587196081.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnrotsn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3iiuz", "parent_id": "t1_fnrnmfg", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1587208674.0, "name": "t1_fnrotsn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/g3iiuz/uk_moves_to_drop_huawei_as_5g_vendor_citing_china/fnrotsn/"}
