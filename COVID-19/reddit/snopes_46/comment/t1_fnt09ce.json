The world can be a big and scary place, full of uncertainty.\n\nHave you ever lain on freshly cut grass on a clear summer night, gazed out over the endless field of stars before you, then had your perspective lurch as you gaze into the endless void gaping beneath you, empty save for a few sparse pinpricks of light?  That second feeling can be a little... uncomfortable.\n\nReplacing that feeling can be necessary just to function, to pay the mortgage, put food on the table, pay attention to the people around us.  We just have to be mindful of our assumptions.\n\nAnother personal observation.  When you listen to interviews about \"debates\" between Young Earth Creationists and evolutionists, there is a fundamental disconnect.  The YEC already *know* how everything is.  They don't accept any evidence counter to what they already know is the truth.  The evolutionist is typically much more circumspect.  The evidence for evolution is overwhelming, we \"understand\" this to be the case.  Their belief is much more fragile and conditional.", "created_utc": 1587232157.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fnt09ce", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g3n9zq", "parent_id": "t1_fnssv0f", "score": 18, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fnt09ce", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/g3n9zq/no_5g_does_not_spread_coronavirus/fnt09ce/"}
