Don't care how smart you are-- you won't outsmart a billion idiots trying out random shit for a thousand years because they were bored. All you can do is stand on the shoulders of giants and try and push the boundary of human knowledge ever so slightly further than it is currently.\n\nI mean FFS, take a look at your phone and try and figure out any detail, at any level, that didn't mint several Ph.Ds. You could literally get a six figure job at Corning if you knew how to make *just the piece of glass on the front of it* 10% stronger. Mining and refining silicon is hundred of years of human effort. The material the circuit board is printed on was hundreds of years in the making. How to make a circuit on that board is an entire industry. How to conceptually organize the programs that utilize that circuitry is yet again, an entire industry.", "created_utc": 1586154637.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkgzmc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvlm8b", "parent_id": "t1_fmk6mca", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586154823.0, "name": "t1_fmkgzmc", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fvlm8b/youtube_will_suppress_content_promoting_false_5g/fmkgzmc/"}
