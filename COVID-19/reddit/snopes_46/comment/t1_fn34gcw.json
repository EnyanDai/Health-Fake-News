It\u2019s been pushed through and approved by those scientific communities that have a vested interest in making money out of it. \n\nMeanwhile, those independent scientists whose research found connections between 5G and cancer, cellular stress and genetic damage have been ignored and their research has not been evaluated and repeated. \n\nThere is evidence that it does kill small animals and we have no way of knowing, (because the towers only operate at short range) that the implementation of thousands and thousands of extra transmitters will not amount to a mass extinction of birds and small mammals. It isn\u2019t the same as tv transmission, if it were it wouldn\u2019t require a mass proliferation of towers to boost signals. \n\nWe just don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll repeat that; independent scientists suspect it will have a devastating effect on wildlife, but no-one wants to do the science to find out.\n\nIf the towers are burning it\u2019s because there are people out there who know that some people will do anything, up to and including mass extinction and irreversible genetic damage to human life, in return for vast amounts of money. \n\nI think it\u2019s worth thinking about other people\u2019s viewpoints and understanding what their concerns are before you start labelling them all as nutjobs.", "created_utc": 1586612590.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fn34gcw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fz3ktu", "parent_id": "t3_fz3ktu", "score": -25, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fn34gcw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/fz3ktu/coronavirus_5g_conspiracy_theory_fuels_arson/fn34gcw/"}
