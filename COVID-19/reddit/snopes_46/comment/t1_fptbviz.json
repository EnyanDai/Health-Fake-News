They're afraid that they're going to lose their job in the energy sector, or their car when it gets ruled \"obsolete,\" or get taxed out of being able to afford fuel, etc. They also fear social judgement, being seen as a bad person because of what they drive or what type of bag they use to carry their groceries. Their reaction to this fear is to go on the offensive, to attack and discredit those who advocate for green policies. The idea is that if everyone thinks these people are idiots worthy of ridicule, then their ideas won't gain traction and nobody will care about what car you're driving anymore. That way their way of life will be safe. Some of this is due to ideas being pushed by media, but some of it is legitimate concerns. For example, taxes levied on industry(or cut subsidies) *will be passed to the consumer* because that's how that always goes, so unless there's an alternative energy source available and at cost parity with the current cost of non-green energy *that fear about their bills going up is valid*.", "created_utc": 1588888425.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fptbviz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gfbygc", "parent_id": "t1_fpt6wke", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fptbviz", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/gfbygc/a_broadband_engineer_was_spat_on_by_a_5g/fptbviz/"}
