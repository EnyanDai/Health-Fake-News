People do not understand that higher frequency does not equal power.  Power is measured in Watts! 5g is a higher frequency and lower power. Which means it can pass along more information quickly, but will be far worse when trying to get signals into your house. The only real negative to 5g is that it requires more towers than 4g because it has a shorter range and cannot penetrate buildings as far. So it takes up additional real estate. I heard they\u2019re trying to put antennas onto buildings in cities but people are boycotting the idea because they do not understand RF. \n\nRF (radio frequency) radiation is non-ionizing. It won\u2019t cause you to mutate like nuclear radiation (alpha, beta, gamma). The way RF hurts you is by prolonged exposure to high power. Think of your microwave. The waves causes the water molecules in your body to move around, so you cook like a hot pocket (from the inside out). The only danger would be from straddling the antenna and cooking yourself (your genitals are mostly water!) but that doesn\u2019t sell newspapers or get clickbait revenue. So we\u2019re left with people not understand the science behind the world they live in. \n\nThere is much more science behind this but I\u2019m trying to keep it easy to read.\n\nEdit: I looked into weather radars (I do not know much about satellites) and yes there is a slight overlap in the frequency band (radar 1-3 gigs and 5g 600 Megahertz to 6 gigs). Don\u2019t worry though most countries have desecrated frequencies so that 5g towers will not use the same frequency (the US has the FCC). And if you\u2019re wondering radars our out so much power it would blank out the 5g towers IF they used the same frequency but they won\u2019t so don\u2019t worry. Before someone\u2019s says something about radars being dangerous, they are built very specifically. They are built at an angle in which their signal will not touch the ground until it is so low power it would barely have the power to penetrate your clothing. \n\nAnd for anyone who didn\u2019t know radar stands for RAdio Detection And Ranging.
