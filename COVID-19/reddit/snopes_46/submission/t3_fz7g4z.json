This is turning out not to be true. Therefore some scientists think there needs to be more testing before widespread roll out.\n\nHere are some relevant quotes from credible scientists and credible journals:\n\nFrom Nature (citation below):\n\n\"... leading us to hypothesize that MMW might alter the permeability of cell membranes, as reported elsewhere.\"...\n\n\"In the future, further studies will be necessary to assess MMW bioeffects on animal models and to investigate potential dysregulations induced by lower IPD values prior to the wide-scale deployment of technologies.\"\n\nFrom International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (citation below):\n\n\"Our quality analysis shows that for future studies to be useful for safety assessment, design and implementation need to be significantly improved.\"\n\n\"... studies are very different and the total number of studies is surprisingly low.\"\n\n\"There is an urgent need for research in the areas of dosimetry, in vivo dose-response studies and the question of non-thermal effects.\"\n\nCitations: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45662-6#citeas\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/18/3406/htm", "stickied": false}
