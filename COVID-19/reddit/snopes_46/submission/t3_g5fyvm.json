I\u2019m 180cm and he\u2019s a bit taller than me)/ diabetes type 2, hypertension, some liver issues. On a bunch of meds. Unsure of names sorry. Lives in Australia. \n\nJust out of nowhere lately he\u2019s reading and believing all these conspiracy theories - and some are so out there. He\u2019s not getting a flu jab anymore because he thinks the government is gonna control us with it. When he talks about them, he seems normal, even does so with a sort of tone that implies he knows it\u2019s a bit ridiculous, but he honestly really believes it. When he\u2019s alone with my mum, I hear him talking about them more seriously. \n\nHe\u2019s a very clever man. Always got top marks in everything he\u2019s done. Has a first degree in history (that\u2019s like the best marks you can get on a degree in the UK), and a teaching degree. Could someone like this just suddenly start believing in conspiracy theories like this, is it a normal progression for some? Or could something else be going on?\n\nEdited to add: \n\nI am sorry I haven\u2019t responded. I am a bit overwhelmed at all the comments, and the responses. I\u2019ll try and cover some main responses in this comment.\n\n1) I know history teacher doesn\u2019t = smart. But I meant it when I said he\u2019s smart. He has immense general knowledge, and could have done many things before choosing to be a teacher in his 40s. He worked in science labs as a younger man. I\u2019m not bragging, just trying to demonstrate that he has the mental cognition skills and isn\u2019t lacking, which makes this more perplexing to me. \n\n2) I asked my mum what she thought of this and she just laughed it off and said he\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d, but not in a concerned way. She is not very good at dealing with any emotions or deep issues and would never seriously address this, hence why I came here. \n\n3) He has always been an anxious person, not in contact with his family (we moved countries 12 years ago) and has mood issues. He used to be very angry growing up, but has actually mellowed the last few years. He\u2019s still fairly mellowed now. He tends to have an obsessive personality, so maybe it\u2019s just manifesting in this.\n\n4) he doesn\u2019t really have more time on his hands. In my country (Australia) and state, schools stayed open and he worked like usual. He\u2019s just started school holidays for 2 weeks which may be leading to his increases searching, but this started when he had his usual routine. \n\n5) I\u2019m not scared of him doing anything crazy (it\u2019s crossed my mind, but I have anxiety issues too and think it\u2019s just that), I\u2019m just worried for him that this could be the start of mental health issues or Alzheimer\u2019s or something. His mum is still alive. Dad died of diabetes complications over 15 year  ago I think.\n\n6) he is on a bunch of medications, but no recent changes to them. But I guess the build up could be contributing.\n\n7) he keeps back flipping quite a lot. One second he says covid is fake and just the flu and just being used to control us, the next second he tells me to be careful of covid when going out. And both times he seems just as serious.  Does this indicate its more or less likely to be an actual medical problem?\n\nThanks!", "stickied": false}
