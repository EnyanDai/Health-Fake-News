Unlike most people I've had hundreds of out of body experiences.  So I'm more sensitive to energy then most people are.  I can sense nearby entities and energy.  And recently I've been sensing some really bizarre energy.  I wasn't sure what it was at first.  But I knew it wasn't some kind of entity and I could tell it was artificial.  So I came to the conclusion that it was 5g.  This energy is not good and probably isn't too good for people.  So I'm pretty sure that 5g is behind all of this.  If so people need to know about it.  So let me know what you think.", "stickied": false}
