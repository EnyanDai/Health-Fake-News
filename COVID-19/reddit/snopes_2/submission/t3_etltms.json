The analysis, part of a collaboration with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, looked at what would happen if a pandemic originated in Brazil&#039;s pig farms.\n\n> The virus in Toner&#039;s simulation would be resistant to any modern vaccine.\n\n> Toner&#039;s simulated pandemic also triggered a global financial crisis: Stock markets fell by 20% to 40%, and global gross domestic product plunged by 11%. &quot;The point that we tried to make in our exercise back in October is that it isn&#039;t just about the health consequences,&quot; Toner said.\n\n\n*****\n[**Summary Source**](https://smmry.com/https://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-simulated-coronavirus-pandemic-deaths-2020-1?amp) | [FAQ](http://autotldr.io/ \"430430 summaries so far.\") | [Feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Toner**^#1 **virus**^#2 **pandemic**^#3 **vaccine**^#4 **coronavirus**^#5\n\nPost found in [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/etl8k0/health_experts_issued_an_ominous_warning_about_a/) and [/r/conspiracy](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/etl8q1/health_experts_issued_an_ominous_warning_about_a/).\n\n*NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.
