Why can't companies sent everything to Asia and save money. It's a work that can be done remotely.\n\nIt's easy to replace an IT person but not an software engineer.\n\nAmazon hired 50 people from my grad school with a salary of 130 K and 40K joining bonus. All of the people I know are working for big tech with yearly salary of 200K plus. 95% Chinese and Indians. \nAn Indian guy joined my company with 4 years stock options worth 700K.\nThese don't look cheap workers to me.\n\nMy buddy joined big 4 with annual salary of 200K.\nNeed more info and data on visa go to the following link. H1b data is public info\n\nH1bdata.info\nLevals.fyi\n\nFYI people on visa need to be paid minimum 65K. Higher than average American HH salary. Core software engineering companies don't cut corners. You know who cut corners? A company whose main job is not software related. Like utility or banking they'll hire cheap workers to build their websites or applications.", "created_utc": 1580095388.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "ffpht48", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_eugeuv", "parent_id": "t1_ffpgjmf", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_ffpht48", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/eugeuv/the_us_scientist_who_predicted_coronavirus_could/ffpht48/"}
