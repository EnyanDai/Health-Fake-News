Or an engineer. It'll be hilarious if you're not and making assumptions about coding standards of others. \n\nI never said 95% of qualified workers are Indian or Chinese but I said they don't do worse job than local Americans. How do I know. I work with them.\n\nH1b workers are actually earning same as others in West coast. There is no other way to prove other than being around them.\nSo learn programming get a tech degree and you'll see the difference.\nWhile they make their millions the locals with just complain :)\nI would rather get my treatment from Dr Ravi  who did his MD from Harvard and is an \nImmigrant than some Tom dick and harry from local med school. \n\nPlus if a company is ready to pay 200K plus for a position they're most likely to pay higher if they find suitable candidate for that position . At that point money is not a constraint they won't hire a cheap worker giving up quality of work for 25-30 K.\n\nYour argument was:\n1. For the same degree the qualifications of Local is higher than foreigner and quality of work too. .\n2. Indians and Chinese code worse than Americans while it's not true. \n3. You tried to put blame of Boeing on cheap programming while that is not the case.\n4. You never answered if you would take a cancer drug researched by Chinese guy if ever needed by you. Rather than answering you went into fake drug argument.\n5. Salaries became suddenly anecdotes. While the fact is average foreign worker makes higher than American household.\n\nThese are not anecdotes. Check the links I provided. H1b.info is govt data. H1b data is public information.\nAlso check out teamblind.com . You can compare salaries of locals and H1b workers.\nOr can talk to any \"local\" who can give inside info.", "created_utc": 1580097080.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "ffpk9mm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_eugeuv", "parent_id": "t1_ffpil8f", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_ffpk9mm", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/eugeuv/the_us_scientist_who_predicted_coronavirus_could/ffpk9mm/"}
