I haven\u2019t backed down on that... I have more reasons if you like? Or you could provide some reasons for your line of thinking?\n\nYour last post just said it would infect the entire world too soon. So yes, you abandoned your argument to essentially say \"well, it doesn't matter\". And my line of thinking is the one established by the various press about vaccines being worked on. I can link to them if you are struggling with it.\n\n> Hyping up vaccines when the WHO and other authorities keep reminding us they won\u2019t help for this next year or two is a form of misinformation. \n\nWho's \"hyping up vaccines\"? No one is saying it's right around the corner. Are you now arguing that it's coming, just in the normal timeframe? The goal posts are roaming everywhere.\n\n> I understand why you want to believe the marketing hype, personally I just choose not to. \n\n\"Marketing hype\"? Uh huh. No, you're dedicated to thinking the worst - that's why, when I pushed back on your arguments, you literally never mentioned them again. You didn't stop and go oh, my points didn't make sense. You just kept shifting to find a new way to be pessimistic about it. \n\n> Most of the people announcing \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d have financial incentives to sound overconfident. \n\nAny company has financial incentives to make a vaccine. Making it up, little short term there. \n\nSo, we went from \"well they didn't make a vaccine for SARS and MERS\", to \"there's no sign there's progress\", to, \"it's not fast enough, the whole world will be infected\", to \"it's a marketing ploy\". \n\nWhat a ride.", "created_utc": 1583272172.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjei9b0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fcr58u", "parent_id": "t1_fjehftw", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjei9b0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fcr58u/pope_tests_negative_for_coronavirus_italy_report/fjei9b0/"}
