That's literally how international relations works. If you want to have a serious discussion about who determines what or who is worth any other nation state's time you seriously have to get off your king shit \"*I* don't contest it\" mentality. \n\nYou don't have an army and you don't control a country. Literally no one cares what you contest. This isn't condescension or pretentiousness, this is the reality of the situation. As someone who was in your shoes previously I recognize the naivety. As someone who shut up and paid attention I can tell you you need to do the same. It's not condescension so much as a whole-hearted recognition of a lack of humility.\n\nAs for what I think the US' duty to come in and dissolve a statehood, you obviously know nothing about the history of south america. Come on, man! Don't talk to me about being condescending when you're the one who didn't do the homework! I even offered to help.
