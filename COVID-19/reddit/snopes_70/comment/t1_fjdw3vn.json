Nobody thought the pope *did* have it, so telling me he tested negative for something is redundant. *That's* why i made the joke, and *that's* what you're not getting i guess lol.\n\n>The pope is obviously asking lmao. Thats why he got tested. \n\nLol you have terrible reading comprehension. I *clearly* ment who *of us reading this* was asking about the pope, and you think i ment *who literally asked him to run the test*....like come on man.\n\n>Its really funny watching immature and ignorant people on reddit blow up when they are called out on their ignorance lmao. \n\nThe only ignorant person here is you, young man. As someone who has clocked *literally thousands* of hours working with ADP's around the world i find it hilarious that someone in your position thinks he knows more about the goings on around the globe then i do, and based off of a joke about a sandwich no less lol. \n\nYou're right, actually..... what's this Corona virus thing? Never heard of it before. It's all new to me, please tell me what you learned on Reddit a week ago, you're a fountain of knowledge.", "created_utc": 1583260392.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjdw3vn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fcr58u", "parent_id": "t1_fjdaoaw", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjdw3vn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fcr58u/pope_tests_negative_for_coronavirus_italy_report/fjdw3vn/"}
