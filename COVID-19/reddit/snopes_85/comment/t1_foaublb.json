Governor Inslee, in my opinion, has made the best of the situation he could, considering he was not able to get the additional [Federal assistance he asked for](https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-statement-federal-major-disaster-declaration) to help keep people afloat when the economy was tanking.  \n\n>My friend is delivering safes, I saw someone getting carpets yesterday, landscapers are out, sports stores near me are open, almost everyone I know is still working, still having parties and get togethers, I think holding onto this shred of \"normalcy\" is making people think it is normal abd not taking it seriously.  \n\nDenial is a coping mechanism ([\"it can't happen to me\"](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/denial/art-20047926)), and for many people, change can be hard to embrace.
