It **IS** your responsibility to avoid endangering it. And if you're carrying a highly contagious virus that has a higher mortality rate than the flu or SARS, and go out into public because, \"It isn't my problem if you catch it,\" then not only are you [exhibiting antisocial/sociopathic tendencies,](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353928) but you are also violating the very Declaration you're touting.\n\nAnd while you're busy copy and pasting the Declaration of Independence between several posts (I looked at your history), which notes the desire to create a government that shall effect **Safety** and Happiness, I want to direct you to that **Safety** part. If you want to go out and endanger the safety of others, willingly, you're going against the very essence of that definition.\n\nFurther, take a look at the Bill of Rights, which helped define more modern eras of personal freedoms. One of those modern definitions came about in 1966:\n\n>The **right** to **health** was again **recognized** as a **human right** in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural **Rights**. Since then, other international **human rights** treaties have **recognized** or referred to the **right** to **health** or to elements of it, such as the **right** to medical care.\n\n[Source](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Factsheet31.pdf)\n\nYou also cite South Korea as a success example, but your implication is that they kept things open without some other element involved. That element was [widespread and early testing,](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/how-south-korea-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve-n1167376) with mapping of contact cases. And I am going to cite a quote from that particular article:\n\n>...people are willing to forgo privacy rights and allow the publication of sensitive information underlines the willingness to pay the digital cost of state surveillance in the name of public safety, said professor Ju Youngkee, who teaches health and data journalism at Hallym University.\n\nThe issuing documents of our Founding Fathers that you often reference heavily hold privacy as a sacred tenet of human rights. Are you willing to let that be violated for the sake of getting back to a normal life?\n\nYour argument is heavily fallacious, with a smattering of [appeal to emotion,](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-emotion) [ambiguity](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ambiguity) on what the Declaration of Independence provides for, and a small sprinkling of [strawman](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman) by misrepresenting no disease in 1776-- that has no relevance to the argument at hand.", "created_utc": 1587663487.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fobth9c", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_g6fhsg", "parent_id": "t1_fobo71p", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvz", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fobth9c", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Washington/comments/g6fhsg/ohio_man_dies_from_covid19_after_criticizing/fobth9c/"}
