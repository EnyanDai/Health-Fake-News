Lol There's no such thing as an argument on the echo chamber known as Reddit. Funny how a micro-percentage of the population that lives on this site thinks the reality they've created here actually exists.  Could you explain some of your responses? What about the response to my statement about Crenshaws interview? have you watched that? Do you care to watch it? Are you willing to be receptive to other ideas? You seem to be attacking almost everyone you come across on Reddit based on your post history, edgelord (lol what? have you actually ever called anybody this in real life?). I simply stated the hypocrisy of people who protest about rights and then pick and choose when rights are applied, along with providing some thoughts on the other side of the coin.  Forget having to try a conversation on this site - I received 2 death threats via DM and about 12 responses, none of them with a sliver of actual conversation. I'll go ahead and hang it up because again, it sounds like you'll just resort to name calling when approached with other ideas. Typical of this site. And Btw, I'm on lockdown. I wear a mask, gloves, etc. when I go out but that's MY choice - and if someone doesn't want to, that's within their rights as well. You know what's even more ironic? All the people who are freaking out about this virus who don't give a shit about their own immune system - their first and most effective line of defense. Probably the same people who want free healthcare but aren't willing to change their own lifestyle habits.", "created_utc": 1587650506.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "foapmce", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5tlnx", "parent_id": "t1_fo966lk", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn7b", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_foapmce", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Ohio/comments/g5tlnx/ohio_man_dies_from_covid19_after_criticizing/foapmce/"}
