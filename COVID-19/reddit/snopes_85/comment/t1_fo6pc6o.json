It's completely logical (and within someone's rights, if that's even a question) to be against the lockdown while still realizing that it's a risk and you can die from it. The logic: You don't crush an economy of 11 million people in Ohio because %0.001 of the population is sick and possibly set up a dangerous precedent that becomes very difficult to overcome economically. Let's even be super aggressive and say it's 20x or 50x current testing numbers - which brings us to .02 or .05%, respectively. I agree with all the lockdown measures and feel like we have done a great job, but we have to find a way back balancing the needs of every American.", "created_utc": 1587564082.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo6pc6o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5tlnx", "parent_id": "t3_g5tlnx", "score": -33, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn7b", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo6pc6o", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/Ohio/comments/g5tlnx/ohio_man_dies_from_covid19_after_criticizing/fo6pc6o/"}
