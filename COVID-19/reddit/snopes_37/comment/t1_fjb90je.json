We knows the force of the Earth's gravity. We know the force provided by the rocket motor. We know how long the rocket fires. We can then easily calculate the distance traveled by the rocket while it fires and the velocity the rocket has at the end of that period. That gives us a distance from the Earth and an initial velocity. We still know the force of Earth's gravity so we have everything we need to plot the rocket's path. Or we can turn it around and calculate what the escape velocity would be for that given distance. If the initial velocity provided by the rocket is greater than the escape velocity, the rocket won't fall back to Earth.\n\nAs far as testing, every probe sent to the Moon, or Mars, or Venus, or the Sun, or the outer planets by the USA, Russia/Soviet Union, China, or anyone else has tested this theory. The US has probes that have left the Solar System.\n\nI don't know whether the Apollo moon missions ever claimed to attain escape velocity, clearly they did. Maybe they didn't see the need to state something so blindingly obvious? In any case, there had to be calculations of the escape velocity from the Moon so that the Astronauts could return to Earth as well.", "created_utc": 1583188901.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjb90je", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fawf9o", "parent_id": "t1_fjb6uky", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjb90je", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fawf9o/is_it_a_coincidence_that_every_election_year_has/fjb90je/"}
