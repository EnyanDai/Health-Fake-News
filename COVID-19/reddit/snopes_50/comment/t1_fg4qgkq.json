It had range of something like 2.4. 4.6.\n\nLatest best guess at the R0 value is 3.1.\n\nH1N1, the last major pandemic that spread uncontrollably had an R0 value of 1.4. The R0 value for SARS was 1.7.\n\nIt is a big deal, and it is reflected in the graphs showing the growth of infected as a result of this virus. It IS spreading far, far faster than SARS. All evidence points to a high R0 value and an extreme propensity for spreading quickly - one not see often in viruses this lethal.\n\nPlease do not trash that man because he's saying things that scare you. He hasn't been wrong. We want accurate information here, not bullshit conjecture. He's at least reporting on what's happening, and I think the degree of panic he's expressing is absolutely warranted by the data he's sharing.", "created_utc": 1580508836.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fg4qgkq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ewtbe6", "parent_id": "t1_fg4c43r", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fg4qgkq", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/ewtbe6/study_finds_that_coronavirus_appears_to_have_been/fg4qgkq/"}
