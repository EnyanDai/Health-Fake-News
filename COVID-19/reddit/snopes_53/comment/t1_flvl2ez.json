This means that the patients are by and large mild cases. For him, the endpoint of the study was that the patients did not die. Assuming a base case fatality rate of 1%, we should expect 692 \u00b1 some error out of 699 patients will recover without chloroquine treatment, which means even with a 1% mortality rate, it's quite possible that all patients would recover on their own. However, since these are mild cases, the fatality rate is substantially lower. Hence, it's a completely reasonable expectation that all patients would recover without chloroquine treatment. Thus, the fact that all patients recovered is not evidence that they recovered because of the chloroquine. To make that claim means we need to compare to a control group and see the differences, performing statistical tests to see if they are significant.\n\nTo put it differently, this is like giving 699 mild COVID-19 patients chocolate bars and then claiming that the chocolate cured their COVID-19 when all 699 recover. The real issue is that all of them probably would have recovered anyway.\n\nTo use a more scientific/statistical parlance, he failed to disprove the null hypothesis.", "created_utc": 1585526164.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flvl2ez", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fr8i87", "parent_id": "t1_flvi3ty", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flvl2ez", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fr8i87/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flvl2ez/"}
