Hydroxychloroquine is NOT a benign drug at all, and it's certainly not a panacea for Covid-19. This article, or the open-label trial of 24 people with some participant censoring that was posted earlier, are NOT sufficient evidence to claim that this works.\n\nThis article is clearly bunk -- with that kind of success rate?? Not even spectacular magic bullet antibiotics work that well; this article is so blatantly ridiculous to anyone with medical training.\n\nIt's not TDS to realize that a proper RCT (which we'll get, with some patience), is necessary. Last I checked, the president isn't a doctor, and isn't known for being the most knowledgable about complex science/medicine or public health, or how to interpret data about medical treatments of novel viruses. Trump could be right, but the evidence is just not there yet -- I wouldn't treat my patients with this, nor my family.\n\nC'mon people, we're all scared, we all want a good treatment. But this is not the magic bullet we're looking for -- we may not know if it's beneficial at all, but we sure as hell know enough to say it isn't the magic bullet. We can't go around claiming we are critically analyzing evidence and hold up garbage like this article!", "created_utc": 1585528872.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flvp7w1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fr8i87", "parent_id": "t1_flvco4v", "score": 22, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flvp7w1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fr8i87/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flvp7w1/"}
