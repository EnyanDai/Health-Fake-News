That is a much better statistic than the general population. We're seeing 5% of positive cases requiring ICU time, many of which requiring weeks of ICU support. If all of his cases show less than 6 days to recover (even if the symptoms were not severe) it completely beats the odds.\n\n>For example, the cases this guy is treating are mild, and thus all patients would likely have recovered anyway without pharmaceutical intervention.\n\nThat's some divine insight you have there. Care to back that up? You're claiming he hand picked people based on mild symptoms. Is that a known case of Covid-19 that the symptoms do not worsen as the virus progresses? Your statement is only true if symptoms remain static, else your conclusion is non-sense.\n\n>These sorts of data do not stand up to scientific and statistical scrutiny.\n\nStating it so doesn't not make it so. You have neither cited his study nor made such a case.
