Traditional cinchona tea recipe/dose was 1-3 grams of Red Cinchona bark a day for malaria. In 1891, Paul Ehrlich himself found that [methylene blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue) (at right, synthetic dyestuffs, showing their stuff) was actually [an antimalarial compound](https://www.esanum.com/today/posts/methylene-blue-found-to-kill-malaria-parasites-in-record-time) - actually better than chloroquinine although it wasn\u2019t really effective enough to take over from quinine itself. Besides, at the doses needed, it tended to turn people (or at least various parts of them) blue. The first sulfonamide drug, [Prontosil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prontosil), tended to permanently turn people red; it was only later discovered that the red dye part was just structural baggage and all the activity was in the little sulfonamide on the side. US agents in the Sino-American Cooperative Organisation (SACO) serving in China and Mongolia reputedly [took Atabrine tablets](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2018/12/30/how-naked-world-war-ii-sailors-ended-up-riding-mongolian-ponies-in-the-gobi-desert-to-shoot-bazookas-at-the-japanese/) to yellow their skin. They didn\u2019t expect to fool anyone face to face, but the disguises helped them blend into the landscape.*\n\nChloroquine played important part in the MedChem history. It was also at the beginning of the [discovery of quinolone class of antibacterials](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ardp.19963290302). The Navy routinely used chloroquine as a chemoprophylaxis against malaria in the 70\u2019s. Hundreds of thousands of doses given with extremely low serious reactions to a young healthy population. Most common complaint was mild diarrhea. One of the problems with chloroquine therapy is a rather low therapeutic window, once we go to high doses. From  toxicology literature, a 2 gram dose hydroxychloroquine in a healthy adult is almost always tolerated, while a 4 gram dose may already lead  to death. Toxic doses of chloroquine are [roughly two-times lower](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-20/virus-drug-touted-by-trump-musk-can-kill-with-just-two-grams).", "created_utc": 1585683939.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm1rypx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_frxej3", "parent_id": "t3_frxej3", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2ugkz", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585690228.0, "name": "t1_fm1rypx", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/frxej3/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/fm1rypx/"}
