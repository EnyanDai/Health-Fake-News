For example something like a mild dose of paracetamol is unlikely to have negative side effects, but if I have a minor ailment which there's only hearsay evidence to suggest it's effectiveness, I'm unlikely to take the paracetamol. And I think that concept (or maybe 'sentiment' is a better term) scales. \n\nHaving said all that, there is a third component to this and that is the neutral state. As in, what's the outcome or potential outcome when there's no treatment at all. Going back to the paracetamol example, if I have a severe and rare auto-immune disease which will slowly kill me with no known treatments and I hear some anecdote that paracetamol can cure me, it adds like a handicap to those 'scales' of positives and negatives in favour of the positive. So for the extreme cases of this virus our risk appetite should be higher because....we don't know what to do. \n\nPulling this full circle, the other issue here is what people are perceiving these drugs to be. There seems to be a lot of people calling for these drugs to be rolled out as some sort of cure or golden bullet, but even in the (slightly sketchy) evidence surfacing so far, these drugs appear to have acted to assist recovery, along with other treatments. I think it's important people don't hype it up to more than it is. Even if these drugs do work for the virus, it seems they'll just be another tool to help treatment. But let's hope for more. \n\n(Sorry that rambled a bit there).", "created_utc": 1585556984.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flwn1dh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fr8i87", "parent_id": "t1_flw2s2n", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flwn1dh", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fr8i87/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flwn1dh/"}
