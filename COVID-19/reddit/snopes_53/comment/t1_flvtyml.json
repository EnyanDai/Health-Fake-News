Then, better yet, don't tell the people administering the medications which ones they are giving and analyze the data after a set period with a set goal -- is your endpoint viral load? % of cases that were treated that required a ventilator? % fatality?  \n\nIf you want to say that if I give 699 Covid-19 patients hydroxychloroquine, and let's see what happens, this is still not that well designed, but slightly closer to what you can conclude -- knowing that I could do the same with 699 other patients and give them candybars and possibly see the same result.", "created_utc": 1585532051.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flvtyml", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fr8i87", "parent_id": "t1_flvrkzm", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flvtyml", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fr8i87/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flvtyml/"}
