By providing it to \"milder\" cases (which ranges heabily in severity from no symptoms to moderate pneumonia), you could prevent future hospitalizations from occuring.  The disease can progress frighteningly quickly, with some cases of healthier younger adults being sent home with mild symptoms, only to be in the ICU days later.  Other cases have people being hospitalized only with moderate symptoms, and die within the day.  A lot of asymptomatic cases end up being instead presymptomatic (and Fauci indicated recently he doesn't think a majority of people are actually truly asymptomatic at this time, and are instead presymptomatic). So, instead of risking developing mild to moderate pneumonia that can turn life threatening over night, this might prevent that from happening. If the treatment shows to be effective at reducing the rate of this progression, a lot of people could be spared hospitalization at a fairly low cost.  \n\n2.  Prophylactically.  This is more hypothetical, and unlikely to ever occur, but the drug has been proposed as a mass prophylactic for other viruses a couple decades ago from what I read.  Basically, as soon as an outbreak starts, dose as many people as you reasonably can in the population and make it impossible for the virus to spread.  With Covid-19, you could starve it out in two weeks to a month.  Again, this is speculative, but I find it interesting.", "created_utc": 1585557404.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flwne9j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fr8i87", "parent_id": "t1_flvl2yj", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flwne9j", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fr8i87/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flwne9j/"}
