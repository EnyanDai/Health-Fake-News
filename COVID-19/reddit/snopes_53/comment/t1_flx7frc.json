I said doctors can and are prescribing this. I am a medical professional developing therapeutics. I fully support using anything at hand in these desperate times. My point is that it's too soon to say who this benefits and who could be at risk. \nWhile dose is certainly linked with long-QT (arrhythmia), there are other risk factors that are not fully assessed. I'm simply explaining why it's not an approved treatment yet and why it's not appropriate to say this is a treatment that can cure COVID-19 in general. We are trying as many combinations as reasonable based on limited evidence but sound scientific basis. We'll get there and in the mean time, we will do everything we can to try and save lives.", "created_utc": 1585576965.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flx7frc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fr8i87", "parent_id": "t1_flv1qe8", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flx7frc", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fr8i87/dr_vladimir_zelenko_has_now_treated_699/flx7frc/"}
