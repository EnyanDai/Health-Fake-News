Any post that alludes to Chinese censorship is being hidden and deleted as \"political.\" I have repeatedly reached out to the moderation team asking them to clarify what constitutes a post about the *policy* of censorship versus the *politics* of censorship but they have not been able to provide any guidance. \n\nIf you search for key terms \"China\" or \"Chinese\" you will find only posts giving officially sanctioned statistics and updates and positive articles about the Chinese government sending aid to other countries. \n\nI was recently banned from the sub for posting the following article:  https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/85440\nImmediately upon posting it, it was invisible. Searching for the post's title, or any words in the title were unable to locate the article. This was confirmed by another user. Five hours later, it was removed as \"political\" and I was permanently banned from the sub, which I have been very active in for over a month. \nI believe that I was flagged as a user and my post was hidden until it could be reviewed. The moderator who removed it has removed many articles from reputable sources not only critical of Chinese censorship, but Western censorship as well. \nMany users have reported that posts about Chinese censorship are removed as \"political.\"\nI believe that the moderation team of r/coronavirus has been infiltrated by agents who are working to protect and promote the image of the Chinese Communist Party. \nThe mod logs of r/coronavirus are mysteriously offline.", "created_utc": 1585314492.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flnb6xw", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_fpwls0", "parent_id": "t3_fpwls0", "score": 25, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flnb6xw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fpwls0/usually_extremely_vigilant_mods_of_rcoronavirus/flnb6xw/"}
