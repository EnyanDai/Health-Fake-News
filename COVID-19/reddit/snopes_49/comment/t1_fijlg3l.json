So, fourteen days later\u2026\n\n----\n\n>But this \u201caccidental release\u201d scenario is *exceptionally* implausible.\n\n>Despite some hand-waving about \u201cprotecting Chinese people\u201d it makes very little sense for the Chinese to bioengineer a virus especially deadly to the Chinese. We are also expected to believe that they then\u2014Oops!!\u2014released it in one of their biggest cities, which is doubly implausible.\n\n>But the timing is the unlikeliest element of all. The virus was released in a leading transportation hub just prior to Lunar New Year, the absolute worst time from the Chinese perspective. An accidental release timed so perfectly is exceptionally unlikely. By contrast, 300 American military personnel had been visiting Wuhan just two weeks prior to the first cases appearing, almost exactly the point at which the virus probably first appeared. What a remarkable coincidence!\n\n>As someone noted, suppose 300 Chinese military officers were visiting Chicago, and then immediately afterwards a deadly new virus suddenly appeared there out of nowhere, with Chinese people perhaps relatively immune. Would the US consider this a mere coincidence?\n\n>Another highly suspicious element is that so many American \u201cconspiracy\u201d websites began promoting the ridiculous notion of an accidental Chinese release so quickly, almost as if some Intelligence agency were all prepared with that cover story. And lots of entirely new commenters such as \u201cAnotherAnon1234\u201d appear from nowhere to try to persuade readers of this website that 1+1=5.\n\n>Very, very suspicious\u2026\n\n[Source](https://www.unz.com/ldinh/hugging-china/#comments)", "created_utc": 1582453558.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fijlg3l", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_f7y4no", "parent_id": "t3_f7y4no", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fijlg3l", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/f7y4no/scientists_say_the_coronavirus_is_a_bioweapon/fijlg3l/"}
