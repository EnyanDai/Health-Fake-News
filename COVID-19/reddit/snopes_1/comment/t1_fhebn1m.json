We test weapons like these on a regular basis, it's no hidden secret. Why would we test weapons we don't have? \n\nAnyone in any sort of higher position in power would have ABSOLUTELY no doubt that these weapons not only exist, but do cause a serious threat if used improperly. Thats what we have had issues here recently with North Korea about. Stating this one idea alone disproves his whole \"position in power\" unless they're brain washing their people in power (which, isn't completely unheard of?
