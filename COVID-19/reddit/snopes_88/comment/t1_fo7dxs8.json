The same number dies, you just spread them out.\n\nBecause if you let a million people die over a few months, totally overloading the hospitals, that won\u2019t increase the death rate from other causes??\n\n>\tUnless you quarantine until a vaccine is available it's all in vain. \n\nExcept that there are existing antivirals already in trials, and other possible therapies like nicotine, which might mean Covid-19 becomes way more treatable within months.\n\n>\tIn the end you're just crashing the economy for extending the lives of some sick people for a couple of months.\n\nAn extremely wrong and retarded misconception.\n\nPeople with serious but manageable conditions don\u2019t have a life expectancy of months. Consider a 30 year old diabetic. Or a kid with leukaemia - the cure rate for childhood leukaemia is 90%. \n\nIt\u2019s also false to assume that someone who is old is just about to die. Let\u2019s say average life expectancy in a country is 80. A 79 year old\u2019s expected life is not 1 year, because reaching 79 means they are healthier than average and they will be expected to live to well above 80.\n\nNow think about healthy 60 and 70 year olds - at much higher risk, but not about to die in a couple of months. \n\nI commend you for trying to think in terms of cost versus benefits, it\u2019s just that your analysis is completely stupid.", "created_utc": 1587576695.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fo7dxs8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g640e7", "parent_id": "t1_fo7cerg", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_hq6n1", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fo7dxs8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/redscarepod/comments/g640e7/sacrifice_the_weak_as_if_covid_isnt_ripping_and/fo7dxs8/"}
