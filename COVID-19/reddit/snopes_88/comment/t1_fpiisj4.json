It's a film where life is perfect, until you turn 30, then you have a duty to die, and if you don't agree, they'll run you down. \n\nThat's the problem with people thinking eugenics makes sense. There will never be a perfect population that deserves to live. We age, get sick, and are sometimes born with health issues. Whittle away at the lives you feel aren't good enough, and you have less and less people left until someone gets smart and does away with the judgemental douche that thinks they're good enough to decide other people's lives for them. \n\nEugenics has been practiced in the US before, but generally, eugenics is unAmerican. If we don't want other people deciding what taxes we have to pay without consulting us, we damn sure have no business deciding who gets to live, or not.", "created_utc": 1588641779.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpiisj4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gdc61w", "parent_id": "t3_gdc61w", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh96", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpiisj4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/self/comments/gdc61w/nothing_pisses_me_off_like_the_protestor_with_the/fpiisj4/"}
