One night there was an ambush Me and this guy Miller got separated from the unit. No food, no radio, nearest base 200 klicks from the south so we just started walking. Well, by the third day i knew we were lost, day six...ran out of water, you know what thats like don\u2019t ya? Difficult to swallow. On the seventh day Millers legs started going all wonky. Did you know your brain starts to eat your muscles in order to survive? Thats why you\u2019re so goddamn skinny. Now by the eighth day, the wolves were closing in. And I looked at Miller and I could tell we were as good as dead and I accepted that, and in that acceptance came clarity. You see I wasn\u2019t just looking at Miller, I was looking at an opportunity. It wasn\u2019t something I wanted...it was something that I had to do. It was, it was my test. Now you see, Miller\u2019s sacrifice wasn\u2019t about me walking out of that desert. It was about bringing me here. The weak have their purpose. You\u2019ll understand that soon enough.", "created_utc": 1575339434.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "f9ikmsn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e59xhg", "parent_id": "t3_e59xhg", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r6z7", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_f9ikmsn", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/copypasta/comments/e59xhg/sacrifice_the_weak/f9ikmsn/"}
