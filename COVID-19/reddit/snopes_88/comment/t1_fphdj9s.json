Anne Frank spent two years in a cramped attic with several other people staying quiet so they wouldn\u2019t get killed by the Nazis, but we have these low-lifes throwing a toddler tantrum because they have to stay inside with their WiFi and TV for a couple of months and paint their own nails. They\u2019re basically sacrificing themselves by doing what they\u2019re doing, and I\u2019d honestly tell them to keep at it so natural selection can run its course if not for the high possibility that these people are going home to their elderly mother or immunocompromised spouse and are putting them in danger.
