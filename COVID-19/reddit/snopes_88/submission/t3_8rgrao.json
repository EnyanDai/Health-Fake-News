It also did away with Transcendence to introduce Transference, a start to fixing Focus 1.0's glaring issues that will eventually be more fully overhauled in Plains of Eidolon.\n\nThe Sacrifice handed us a new Warframe, nikana, and five primed set mods on a silver platter, and... that's it. There's no direct post-quest content at all outside of just playing with our new toys and probably Forma-ing to get the most performance out of them, plus farming for endo to max the primed set mods. Although the quest itself was pretty great, I've quickly run out of new things to do (and quickly ran out of Forma due to the exalted weapon modding changes), and so I'm going back to the same old content again. The update didn't leave much of a legacy behind. Umbra is fun, though!", "stickied": false}
