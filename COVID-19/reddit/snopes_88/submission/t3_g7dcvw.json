What was different about the person who made the sign was that they were an ordinary person, not a politician or celebrity or pundit. That was the point.*\n\n*The protest was fake in the way all the recent protests against social-distancing policies and the closure of the U.S. economy have been:* [*Organized*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/us/politics/coronavirus-protests-trump.html) *and supported by right-wing activists and politicians, and presenting the iconography of a populist uprising while expressing a position unpopular even within the Republican Party, these sham protests' purpose is to draw attention to their own existence. They're a function of an attention economy in which the willingness to say the most outrageous thing you can think of is a kind of power that can be effortlessly weaponized.* \n\n*The protest was also real, though: An ordinary person actually did make the sign and carry it out into the world, achieving their ends, and those of others. The purpose of calling for the weak to be sacrificed is to let people know that you've done so; the purpose of ginning up a protest at which someone will do so is to amass power. The only question is the use to which that power will be put. We already know the answer: It will be used by those who want people to go back to work and make their employers richer even if it kills tens of thousands or more, because they would rather have that happen than adopt the social welfare policies of a civilized nation.*\n\n[https://www.vice.com/en\\_us/article/pkej8y/the-right-wing-wants-you-to-die](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pkej8y/the-right-wing-wants-you-to-die)", "stickied": false}
