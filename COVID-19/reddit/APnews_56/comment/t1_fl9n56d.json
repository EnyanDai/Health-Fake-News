That gives a total of 280 million cases in total.\n\nNow let's just go with an overall mortality of 1%. It's lower for young people and higher for the elderly. But let's just say 1% as a conservative guess. That mortality rate in combination with 280 Million cases would mean 2.8 million deaths.\n\nThat's a pretty big hit, but still would not explain 20 million less cellphone users.\n\nIf we go from the opposite direction?\n\nLet's assume that the cellphone numbers represent the actual number of deaths (ie. reject all other explanations).\n\n21 million/1.4 Billion gives 0.015 or 1.5% f the total population. If you are willing to consider a slightly higher mortality and a greater overall prevalence (most of the population infected instead of just 20%) this figure is plausible.\n\nThe associated realizations are staggering though. China can take a hit of 21 million deaths and keep right on going. Their population is so large and so tightly controlled, they can hide 21 million deaths from their own people (maybe) and the rest of the world (probably).\n\nAll of this is just speculation though. If there's a different explanation for the missing cell phone users... or if the report turns out to be false... this all goes away.", "created_utc": 1584962902.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fl9n56d", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fni4z1", "parent_id": "t1_fl9mhk3", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fl9n56d", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/fni4z1/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/fl9n56d/"}
