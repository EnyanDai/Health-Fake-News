That many dead in three months would be absurd.\nAnyone who thinks this is anywhere near true or a reasonable death count is a mental midget of the highest order.   \n\nHeck even the nazis who ran a purpose designed body disposal system on a national level couldn\u2019t have disposed of that many bodies that fast.  Their best cremator facilities like Auschwitz with  8 cremators could dispose of 10,000 murdered bodies a month. Thats also with open pit burning. Even with terrible ww2 level optics on us recon planes we could tell they were burning massive amounts of bodies. in an age of cellphones with cameras and global internet and satellites it is impossible to hide that level of death.", "created_utc": 1585339082.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "floiqze", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fpwlqp", "parent_id": "t1_flo93by", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_floiqze", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fpwlqp/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/floiqze/"}
