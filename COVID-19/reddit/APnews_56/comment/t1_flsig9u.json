Let's just say it was 4 complete years for simplicity.\n\n4 years x 365 days = 1,460 days\n\n6,000,000 Jews / 1,460 days = 4,110 killed per day\n\n4,110 dead bodies per day x 120lbs = 493,200lbs of corpses disposed of per day.\n\nSo using ~~your~~ the previous commenter's math this would mean there were 11 fully loaded semi trucks of bodies to dispose of every day.  That's a lot of bodies.\n\nBut wait you say, they didn't bury the bodies.  They incinerated them in ovens.  Ok let's do that math.\n\nA modern cremation requires 28 gallons of fuel.\n\nThat means they would need to expend the energy equivalent of 115,080 gallons of fuel per day to incinerate them in ovens.  (4,110 bodies x 28 gallons). That seems like quite a lot.  Panzer tanks had 120 gallon fuel tanks.  So this same amount of fuel used per day would fill the fuel tanks of 959 separate Panzer tanks.\n\nBut wait you say, they didn't incinerate them properly, they were only killing them, not making them into ash.  Even though this means it would take more time, resources, energy, and manpower as opposed to cooking them into ash, let's entertain that point.\n\nLet's assume the Nazis weren't concerned with doing a great job at incinerating the bodies and only used half as much fuel as needed to cremate the bodies.  If they used 14 gallons per victim that still means they would need the energy equivalent of 57,540 gallons of fuel per day, enough to fill up 480 Panzer fuel tanks.\n\nWhen you look at the math, it seems pretty illogical that the Nazis would have expended so many resources just to get rid of the Jews.\n\nWhen you look into history you see the 6 million number used to describe many other transgressions against the Jews.  The Nazis killed Jews in the Holocaust.  They also killed a lot of other people too.\n\nThe 6 million number is total bullshit.", "created_utc": 1585442856.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flsig9u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fpwlqp", "parent_id": "t1_fls77uf", "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585450147.0, "name": "t1_flsig9u", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fpwlqp/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/flsig9u/"}
