Clearly, the number of people with multiple cell phones is quite significant, many of them most likely didn't need to keep their second cell phone while they were quarantined or had lost their job.\n\nBetween Mar '19 and Jun '19, the number of cell phone accounts went down by 11 million.  The number they're down now, with a pandemic, strict quarantines, businesses closing, and people losing their jobs is only twice what it was down during normal times.  Their implication that this number can be in any significant way explained by people dying from COVID-19 is absolutely asinine.", "created_utc": 1585347202.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flowzu5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fpwlqp", "parent_id": "t1_floj7jv", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flowzu5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fpwlqp/21_million_fewer_cellphone_users_in_china_may/flowzu5/"}
