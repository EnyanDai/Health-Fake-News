Just quickly glancing at the geography of that area and locations for reports... That'd be pretty consistent with Wuhan going pandemic and press to the contrary, all those hospitals they built were just that - for show. There was no curve flattening, they took it on the nose and China maybe was able to contain it but it's more likely they just cut the wires and waited for everyone to die, then came back with \"everything is fine.\"\n\n\nBasically what Trump wants here - a made-for-tv quarantine before sweeping it under the rug. No tests = nobody sick. Get those factories open, we're fine! Er, well, they were uhh old... Or it's uhh... Seasonal allergies to peanuts. The show must go on! Those numbers say what really happened in Wuhan:\n\n\nThey locked everyone in and then collected the bodies quietly while nobody was looking. See? All fine here! No positive tests = no cases. They know it'll be months to years before anyone can prove otherwise. By then, it'll be over and nobody will care. \"business as usual\". Nobody will say anything because they'll risk upsetting China and slowing economic recovery.\n\n\nThat's their plan.
