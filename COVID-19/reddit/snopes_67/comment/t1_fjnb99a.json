Vatican employees and their families are eligible for health care at the clinic.\n\nOne Vatican official was put into a protective quarantine after a priest from France\u2019s Catholic church in Rome tested positive for the virus. The official isn\u2019t showing symptoms of COVID-19 disease but lives in the same church as the infected priest.\n\nThe Vatican Apostolic Library said it would keep its doors shut all next week as a precaution. The library welcomes scholars from around the world to consult the Vatican\u2019s manuscripts and archives.\nFrancis came down with a cold over a week ago, and the Vatican has said that he has no other pathologies. The 83-year-old pope, who lost part of one lung to a respiratory illness when he was a young man, canceled his participation at a week-long spiritual retreat in the Roman countryside as a result.Bruni said this week that the pope\u2019s recovery from the cold was proceeding well, and that he continued to celebrate daily Mass, receive visitors privately and perform other spiritual exercises.\n\nFrancis however canceled several official engagements in the last two weeks, as coronavirus spread from northern Italy to other parts of the country, including Rome, albeit in much smaller numbers.\nThe Italian government has ordered all sporting events to take place without spectators and has urged the cancellation of all mass gatherings. As a result, it is likely that the pope\u2019s general audiences will be canceled. In addition, given Francis\u2019 age and health condition, under government measures advising the elderly to avoid going out, the pope should stay home and limit visitors.", "created_utc": 1583503266.0, "distinguished": "moderator", "id": "fjnb99a", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_feduqo", "parent_id": "t3_feduqo", "score": 1, "stickied": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dqnia", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjnb99a", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/cvnews/comments/feduqo/vatican_confirms_1st_coronavirus_case_as_pope/fjnb99a/"}
