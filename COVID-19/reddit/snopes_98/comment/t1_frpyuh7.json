You can kiss goodbye to America as we know it. These leftists worship the state. The government is their God. Media tells no lies to these people. Just look how fast they embraced the Fascist measures. It is like everything the forefathers built is at risk to completely change in just a few months.. Biden is apparently gaining in the polls amidst a myriad of scandals and it doesn't matter. Not to mention the guy is going senile but it doesn't matter. \n\nThey're okay with reinstating the administration that ruin people's lives to stay in power (i.e. Flynn, Stone, KT McFarland). They are unconscionable. Notice how we left the Iran deal and terrorist threats have completely been diminished. Obama basically killed NASA and dreams of going to space. They just want autocracy and control over the populous. When I saw the Space Force ad, I got chills. We were poised to reach the stars partnering with the  private sector. \n\nWe were on the cusp of a Golden age before the pandemic. Record low unemployment had led to excess demand for labor. We were finally seeing wage growth for the first time since the 70s really. We will be globalist slaves if Biden wins and I dont think thats an understatement.", "created_utc": 1590366388.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "frpyuh7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gpv45x", "parent_id": "t1_frpt1q6", "score": 28, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1590381894.0, "name": "t1_frpyuh7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/gpv45x/they_did_it_again_cbs_caught_using_photo_from/frpyuh7/"}
