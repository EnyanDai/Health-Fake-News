I think it has more to do with the general nature of the media in the modern world. CNN, FOX, they know their audience and they know what brings them back to keep clicking. \n\nClicks = revenue\n\nA lot of their audiences love the \"debunk those stupid conspiracy theorists\" narrative and will immediately make any claim that doesn't abide by official stories being put out by governments as such. They get a sense of superiority for not believing stories peddled by what they perceive as whackjobs. It's the same with other media outlets that have audiences that are very skeptical about a government's official statement, they'll come out and tote the \"is this really what is going on?\" line to keep them coming. These people get the same sense of superiority as the \"anti-conspiracy\" crowd because they are smarter for not buying official narratives. \n\nAt the end of the day, I just wish journalists and media outlets across the spectrum would just be honest and admit we don't know where it came from right now and that all possibilities are being considered.", "created_utc": 1586191688.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmlr4js", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvypds", "parent_id": "t1_fmlpuf0", "score": 17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmlr4js", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fvypds/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmlr4js/"}
