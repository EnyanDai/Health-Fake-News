The Chinese government takes a good, hard look at itself and makes serious changes.\n\n2. There is a civil war with lots of deaths AND a necular power potentially loses control of some of its stockpile of weapons in the process. That's terrifying shit right there. \n\n3. Outside forces remove the government which would likely involved a necular exchange - and that's worse than this pandemic by a large margin.\n\nThe first one won't happen and the second two are unacceptable. In the case of number two, number three would happen as foreign government's get involved partially to stop the weapons from being lost and ending up in the hands of who knows who.", "created_utc": 1586274636.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmp568u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvypds", "parent_id": "t1_fmllfg0", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmp568u", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/fvypds/boris_johnsons_government_reportedly_believes_the/fmp568u/"}
