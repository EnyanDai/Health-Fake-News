Many leftists who repeat this lie haven't even bothered to look up the speech to see what he said. We here in /r/Conservative are not so capricious. Here is the quote from the speech:\n\n>One of my people came up to me and said, \u201cMr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.\u201d That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.\n\nLiterally the next thing he said was acknowledging that there were cases, but based on what he said, the Virus itself isn't the hoax, it's the Democrats' tactics. Even the website I pulled the speech from [says](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-charleston-south-carolina-rally-transcript-february-28-2020):\n\n>It\u2019s unclear if he was referring to the virus itself, the politicization of the virus, or the media\u2019s response to the virus.\n\nSnopes, the \"fact checking\" website that is deeply biased against Donald Trump and conservatives [said](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-coronavirus-rally-remark/):\n\n>Despite creating some confusion with his remarks, Trump did not call the coronavirus itself a hoax.\n\nIf you spread this lie, you are literally joining in on the actual hoax by spreading lies that Trump said something that he did not say. Leftists are spreading the misinformation and lies, not us.", "stickied": false}
