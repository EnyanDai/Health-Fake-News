Every neutral health expert agrees that not having 20,000 Chinese a day landing in the states helped slow, not stop, the virus buying us a bit more time.\n\nJoe Biden called the travel ban xenophobic, lots of cosmopolitan media then published horrible articles on how travel bans do nothing (which is patently false) that I'm sure you can link.\n\nYes, I would say, as someone who has never voted Republican that the fucking Democrats lied out their ass to politicize the situation. Then, the DNC refused to postpone primaries leaving many in various states stuck in lines with each other waiting to vote. Horrible, horrible, incredibly stupid & self serving.\n\nLuckily folks like (Democrat) Andrew Cuomo are actually leading and not engaged in trying to talk out the ass and mouth at the same time.", "created_utc": 1584545066.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fku9hqo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fknh9x", "parent_id": "t1_fku8f0f", "score": -9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9a", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584545334.0, "name": "t1_fku9hqo", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldpolitics/comments/fknh9x/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fku9hqo/"}
