You gotta be careful to not fall for fake news like that. Even leftist snopes says Trump did not call the virus a hoax.\n\n>Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019 They go, \u2018Oh, not good, not good.\u2019 They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa, they can\u2019t even count. No they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t count their votes.\n>\n>    One of my people came up to me and said, \u2018Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn\u2019t work out too well.

It\u2019s all turning, they lost, it\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We\u2019re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\n\nContext is important.", "created_utc": 1586320133.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmrdj9u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fwylj1", "parent_id": "t1_fmr8xbc", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmrdj9u", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fwylj1/nbc_still_pushing_fake_news_that_trump_called/fmrdj9u/"}
