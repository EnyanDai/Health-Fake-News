What is interesting to me is that his statements around that time could be construed as downplaying it, while some of his actions told a different story; for example, the travel ban.\n\nSo his words indicated one thing, and at least some of his actions indicated the opposite.\n\nMeanwhile, some mainstream media outlets seemed to argue against the travel ban at the time, which I\u2019m not sure if we should consider that as also downplaying it - hence my question.\n\nBased on one of the people\u2019s posts in this thread, it seems pretty clear that Hannity and some others were also downplaying it, which I\u2019m not surprised by at all given their political bent. However, I also can\u2019t verify that on my own, since I quit paying attention to Hannity years ago.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not surprised by them downplaying it, I don\u2019t have a good understanding of what they specifically said or did to downplay it. Again, due to the fact that I just don\u2019t pay attention to those types of opinion journalism anymore.\n\nNow, all that rambling aside, there are plenty of examples of opinion journalists at the end of January/beginning of February that were arguing against a travel ban. Some political leaders continued to argue against a travel ban as late as March 12. So that sticks out to me as an interesting aspect of this situation, because you have specific tactics that indicate taking it more or less seriously, while at the same time comments on it that may indicate the opposite. And some people - like president trump for example - seemed to come down on both sides of thay coin at the exact same time, creating mixed signals at best, in my personal opinion. \n\nIf you are serious and want me to actually list specific examples to further discuss it, I can.", "created_utc": 1585092226.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flev9im", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fnv8fy", "parent_id": "t1_flco9oy", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3a6w2", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flev9im", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/media_criticism/comments/fnv8fy/washington_post_reporter_has_apologized_for_and/flev9im/"}
