I said that the top Democrat brass, right under the WH, weren\u2019t screaming about a coming pandemic! They were too busy trying to impeach the President on bullshit reasons.

Where the virus already was, and probably spread like wildfire there bc of her actions. But nah it\u2019s ALL Trump\u2019s fault...why cant any of you accept that multiple people failed? Multiple levels of government failed? PPE stockpiles hadn\u2019t been replenished since BUSH was President??? Obama has the chance to fix that and didn\u2019t, but where is the outrage for his mistakes?? Oh wait, he\u2019s your savior....so he\u2019s cool.", "created_utc": 1588641562.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpiifgw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t1_fpi43pp", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpiifgw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fpiifgw/"}
