I feel like I try to give this administration as much credit as I can when they do the right thing, try to find multiple sources from different perspectives so I can hopefully get the full picture, call out my fellow progressives who don\u2019t know what they are talking about act like idiots and repeat MSM lies, and I still constantly get told by conservatives that I\u2019m just looking for something to complain about. It just feels like Trump is beyond reproach for many people and I think that\u2019s really unhealthy. \n\nI understand there\u2019s been a ton of hyperventilating on the left about everything Trump does. It\u2019s pushed and distorted by a lot of the media and unfortunately it\u2019s caused a further sense of division. I fell for it for a while. I think Trump is a poor President. I think he lacks the mental fortitude and a deep sense of empathy, BUT actually think he\u2019s mostly harmless (I personally worry more about those around him). \n\nBut as a country I believe we need to be clear eyed when it comes time to evaluate this crisis. We should defer to expert epidemiologists and public health experts. IMO I think we\u2019ll find that the choices this admin made early on cost us valuable time and in the end many more lives & money. I\u2019m not suggesting any malicious intent. I\u2019m suggesting lack of understanding of the severity and therefore a lack of effective preparation.", "created_utc": 1585719678.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm3d90z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fsru23", "parent_id": "t1_fm3cbse", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm3d90z", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fsru23/no_trump_never_called_coronavirus_a_hoax/fm3d90z/"}
