On Feb 1 most people did not see this getting as big as it did. Ignorance? Maybe. False expectation that the Government would have us prepared. More likely. I was telling my family how bad its going to get by March 10 when Trump said it will go away.

I would say he was 2-4 weeks late in the lock down. We should have been manufacturing PPE like crazy by mid-feb.
