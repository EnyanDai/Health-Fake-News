{"author": {}, "body": "Regarding concern over the coronavirus outbreak/response \u2014\u00a0Trump called it a hoax created by Democrats and the media.\n\n[**From the transcript of his S. Carolina \"speech\"**](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-charleston-south-carolina-rally-transcript-february-28-2020)**:**\n\n>\t**One of my people came up to me and said, \u201cMr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.\u201d That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was not a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.** \n\n*People are saying!!!!1!!!*\n\n>\tBut we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early, we could have had a lot more than that. We\u2019re doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified. We are so unified. The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now. There has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now. Never been a movement. \n\nIn the next breath, he **conflates** the loyalty of his **voters** *and* campaign for **re-election** with the coronavirus outbreak and response. \n\n>\tSo a statistic that we want to talk about, go ahead. Say USA. It\u2019s okay. USA.   \n>\t\n>\tSo a number that nobody heard of, that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? 35,000, that\u2019s a lot of people. It could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000. They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die. And so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. \n\nNext, he **conflates** annual **flu data** with the coronavirus outbreak and response. \n\n>\tAnd it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t and we are totally prepared. It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t, but think of it. **You hear 35 and 40,000 people and we\u2019ve lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode.** \n\nNow he\u2019s **conflating** the **\u201dnew Democratic hoax\u201d** with **\u201dthe media\u201d** ***reporting*** about concerns over the coronavirus outbreak/response. \n\n>\t**CNN fake news and the camera just went off,** the camera. The camera just went off. Turn it back on. Hey, by the way, hold it. Look at this, and honestly, all events are like this. It\u2019s about us. It\u2019s all about us. I wish they\u2019d take the camera, show the arena please. They never do. They never do. \n\nFinally, **he calls the media fake**. \n\n>They never do it. They never show the arena. You can hear it because when you hear it, that\u2019s not 200 people. That\u2019s not a hundred people. That\u2019s thousands and thousands of people including people outside. You can hear it.   \n>\t\t>They always show my face. See that face? They show my face. I want them to show the arena, not my face, right? How many have you been to? How many rallies have you gone? ...\n\nThen \u201cfalls off the stage\u201d (figuratively) in a narcissistic aside. \n\n... Later, he circles back, ya know, to reiterate: \n\n>**While the extreme left has been wasting America\u2019s time with these vile hoaxes**, we\u2019ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, and lifting up citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.", "created_utc": 1583129214.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fj920vv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fc6g9l", "parent_id": "t1_fj90c1z", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fj920vv", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fc6g9l/video_reporter_shuts_down_bloomberg_after_he/fj920vv/"}
