{"author": {}, "body": "i'v been in my current job for the last 7 years. Holy shit it only feels like it's been 2 or 3 years lol.\n\nIt's crazy how time just melds together when you don't have things like summer break to break up the years. up until recently I never used my vacation for much other than fucking off at home extending a handful of weekends into 3 to 4 day weekends, which is nice and all, but this year I am planning on camping a lot with a bunch of my good friends and hopefully one big backpack camping trip at some point, so im hoping doing things like that will start to break up and define my years other than what games i'm planing at the time or what collectibles I'v found (this year has been a year of ww2 flight helmets for me lol. I'v found plenty of other types of things, a extremely rare land mine, 1600's Japanese arrow head, the M17 pistol I bought and put a DPP on ect, but my flight helmet game has been doubled with a ww2 US summer fabric pattern full setup  that I need to get a foam head for and a brit ww2 trainer / spitfire helmet.)", "created_utc": 1584557447.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkuwi53", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fjfm1h", "parent_id": "t1_fkuuhms", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2vcl0", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkuwi53", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/ShitPoliticsSays/comments/fjfm1h/user_in_rcoronavirus_gets_32_for_repeating_lie/fkuwi53/"}
