He should treat it like a war.\n\nThis just shows how bad of a \"war time\" president he actually is (edit: or would be).\n\nAs others have said time and time again, if he handled this well and just listened to his knowledgeable advisors his support would probably be soaring right now. Instead he shot himself in the foot and had to insist he knows best and here we are (for better or for worse given its an election year).\n\nAnd I want to note, I realize for those who have lost someone to this virus the \"for better or for worse\" comment may seem a bit heartless... And it is. But for the good of the country's future, avoiding another 4 years of trump may save far more lives than this virus takes... Assuming we actually get him out of office this fall/next Jan.   \nWhatever the situation, be sure to get out and vote. I live in MA and there's about no chance of trump winning here but still, I'm damn sure I'll be voting regardless of how solid the democratic lead is here or the method of voting we take (in person vs mail in).
