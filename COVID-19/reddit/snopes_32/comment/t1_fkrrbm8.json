He denied the facts. And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cIt\u2019s the\u2014it\u2019s the administration. Perhaps they do that. You know, people let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.\u201d\n\n>But 2018 video footage resurfaced Tuesday by the British newspaper The Independent contradicts him. \u201cYou have consistently called for enormous cuts to the CDC, the NIH, and the WHO,\u201d a White House reporter tells Trump. \u201cYou\u2019ve talked a lot today about how these professionals are excellent, are critical, are necessary. Does this experience give you pause about those cuts?\u201d\n\n>\u201cNo,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cWe can get money, we can increase staff\u2014we know all the people. This is a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven\u2019t used for many, many years, and if we have ever need them we can get them very, very quickly. And rather than spending the money\u2014I\u2019m a business person. I don\u2019t like having thousands of people around when you don\u2019t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/trump-defended-cuts-public-health-agencies/608158/", "created_utc": 1584474479.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkrrbm8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka5wb", "parent_id": "t1_fkrhzmd", "score": 20, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkrrbm8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka5wb/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fkrrbm8/"}
