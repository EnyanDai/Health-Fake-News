He is held accountable by the media. \n\nHim acknowledging when he\u2019s wrong has no relation to the concept of being held accountable. \n\nHolding someone accountable, from a media perspective, is asking that person to say why they said or did something. The news media\u2019s job is to report that. The opinion media\u2019s job is to comment on that. Specifically with Trump, he\u2019s held accountable all the time. \n\nNow, we can get deeper in the weeds and talk about individual outlets, and how some hold him accountable in a way that many would say is unfair, while other outlets barely hold him accountable at all, which is also arguably unfair.\n\nBut it seems like we are getting stuck with people injecting their own personal or political views on the topic, when at least for me, my focus is purely on the media criticism side of things - at least in this sub. \n\nMy initial, broader point remains the same - that he is attacked by the media when it is warranted, as well as when it is not. My fear is that always beating the same drum will lessen the impact in the times when it is legitimate, because it can be hard to tell the difference the two since the media reacts the same way no matter what he says or does. \n\nAnd that makes it easier for him to simply wave his hands and say \u201cfake news,\u201d even when it\u2019s not. \n\nAm I making sense at all? Hopefully I am, but it\u2019s been a very trying day so I may just be doing a really poor job of explaining my point.", "created_utc": 1585091490.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fletyv1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fnv8fy", "parent_id": "t1_fleccf4", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3a6w2", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fletyv1", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/media_criticism/comments/fnv8fy/washington_post_reporter_has_apologized_for_and/fletyv1/"}
