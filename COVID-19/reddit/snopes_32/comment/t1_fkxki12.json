The bar is inescapably high for people who hate him. It's too low to lose for people who like him.\n\nI'd be happy if people just quit pretending it was about him at all. It isn't. People love or hate him based on the color of his tie. The entire Dem party abandoned him because he ran on Hillary's 2008 platform *while they were running Hillary*. The Reps accepted him because screw the Dems.\n\nIt's a sick game. He hasn't done anything substantially different than his predecessors except stopping the flow of traffic to the country (because *this* time the pandemic is coming from China instead of Africa). \n\nIt doesn't matter whether the expert brought in to work out a response has a title or not; they're there, they are working. There's more resources on this than any pandemic before because it has a dozen times more points of infection.
