He then called the criticism of his total lack of response and the hysteria around it a hoax. Google it my man.\n\nSo not only did he do nothing for weeks while he could\u2019ve been doing a lot, including accepting WHO testing kits and advising Americans on the dangers of what was to come, but he then called the response to Corona and his actions a hoax. \n\nGoogle it my man. \n\nIt\u2019s insane how many excuses you make to cover him. It\u2019s scary to think how quickly you switch track and doublethink to align with his dictations.\n\nIf he really \u201cknew it was a pandemic,\u201d his response left America disgustingly unprepared. Every action and word backed up his belief it was a Democratic hoax and MSM hysteria until his hand was forced and he made this statement to cover it up.", "created_utc": 1584493584.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fksmq2c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka5wb", "parent_id": "t1_fkslg04", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584493906.0, "name": "t1_fksmq2c", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka5wb/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fksmq2c/"}
