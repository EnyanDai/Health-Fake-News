As for his followers, there are layers and layers to that argument. Without us being here forever, it is likely that many of them fear that which makes them uncomfortable and he has given them a pass to stay blissfully unaware; this is apparent in his overt racism, his views on women and their bodies, his threats to withhold aid to Blue states and anyone who \"doesn't thank him\", and his unfounded assertions about COVID-19, its cures, and it expected future trends. Regardless, his followers are a blend of sheeples, racists, homophobes and transphobes, and woman-haters.
