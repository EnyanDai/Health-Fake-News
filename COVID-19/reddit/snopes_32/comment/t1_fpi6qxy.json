LOL.\n\nEven beyond them, transcription is an actual legitimate *problem* with this guy. Translation is even worse. (Same thing really: transcribers basically have to translate him into English.) When his term started, professional transcribers and translators worldwide were having near-breakdowns trying to commit his verbal diarrhea to paper. (I'm barely even joking: one described Trumpese as quote, \"an unprecedented and desolating struggle.\" Damn. Send help.)\n\nHe rambles, he wanders, he interrupts himself constantly but never goes back to finish a thought. The em dash has never had to work so hard. He uses weird idiomatic turns of phrase, weirdly. He goes off-script constantly, giving simultaneous captioners heart attacks because who knows whereTF he's headed. Despite being an important head of state, he's too crass for publication in a lot of outlets. Once you figure out how to translate \"grab 'em by the pussy,\" can you even print that?? And of course the big one, his actual sentences\u2014 words *and* content\u2014 *don't make any friggin sense.* They're writing it down but they're baffled. And/or cringing: \"He is so overconfident and yet so logically unconvincing that my friends and I often joke that if we translated his words as they are, we would end up making ourselves sound stupid.\"\n\nIt's kind of funny\u2026 yet it's kind of not. \n\nLadies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.       \nsigh", "created_utc": 1588634778.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpi6qxy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t1_fpi1vao", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fpi6qxy", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fpi6qxy/"}
