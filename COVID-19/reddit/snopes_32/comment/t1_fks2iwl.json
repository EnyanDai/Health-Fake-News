They have defended him relentlessly for things that, if Bernie had done, they would have eviscerated him.\n\nPicking literal fights with Wisconsin union voters? Plucky! Telling female staffers to \"hush\"? In control! Telling people to go for for trump instead? Confident! Acting lost and senile and cranky like someone in early onset dementia? Good ole' Joe! I could go on and on and you know damn well if Bernie had done any of those, the media would be screaming he is disqualified. When Bernie was  leading and winning, it was \"How do we stop Bernie?!?!?!?\" When Joe picked up his first win, \"It's OVER! Bernie should just drop out now!\"\n\nSo yeah, Biden is winning now. Now that everyone in power is cheering him on and telling all their viewers Bernie would end this country and Biden is the savior. Bernie WAS winning, and would STILL be winning if the media and DNC and party propped him up like they have Biden. Once everyone ganged up and consolidated their efforts to just burying Bernie under a barrage of bullshit, then suddenly Biden starts winning primaries.\n\nBut you think Biden will get the same level of support and defense and propping up from the msm once he is in the general against trump? Ha! They are going to go after him and CREAM him. Biden will lose to trump. And a side note, the DNC better start learning to listen to their progressive voters or they are done as a party.", "created_utc": 1584480940.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fks2iwl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka1ke", "parent_id": "t1_fkrtews", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fks2iwl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka1ke/trump_who_has_previously_called_the_coronavirus_a/fks2iwl/"}
