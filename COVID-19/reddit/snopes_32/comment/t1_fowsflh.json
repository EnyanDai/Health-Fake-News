We have emails from people warning this is going to go badly, but Trump undercutting it. CIA warned the White House in November 2019 about the growing outbreak in Wuhan, but Trump didn\u2019t care to pay attention to daily briefings (that\u2019s been an ongoing problem for the last 4 years). In January HHS officials tried to get ahold of the White House but Trump cared more about whether they would legalize flavored vaping so his supporters would be happy. In February HHS requested $2 Billion in PPE and Trump cut the requisition by 75%. Later in February Secretary of State Pompeo announced he was shipping supplies to China to help them, over the objections of HHS. \n\nTrump steered the ship into an iceberg, and you\u2019re blaming the people in the engine room.", "created_utc": 1588126156.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fowsflh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g9lq1u", "parent_id": "t1_fouklz4", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3irqb", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fowsflh", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/esist/comments/g9lq1u/us_intelligence_agencies_gave_trump_more_than_a/fowsflh/"}
