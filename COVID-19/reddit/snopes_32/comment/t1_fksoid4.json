After reading his remarks on snopes, I'm confused what he meant by hoax.\n\nPreviously I was under the impression that he called the threat of COVID-19 to be a hoax.\n\nBut he said , \"They tried the impeachment hoax......And this is their new hoax.\"\n\nFirst of all he was impeached, so what was the hoax there?  In his opinion, that he committed crimes.  So using the same logic, he may have meant that saying that he was handling the coronavirus poorly was the \"hoax\".\n\nIMO, Trump is an idiot and he has handled this outbreak poorly.  He hurt the ability of the United States to handle a pandemic.  And he deliberately underplayed the severity of the outbreak.  Saying that he called the coronavirus a hoax is misleading.
