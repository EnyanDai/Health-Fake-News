You left out the part where he referred to the democrats politicizing his response. Why the fuck would the president call it a hoax in the same paragraph where he addresses the 15 positive cases. I'm tired of you dirty lying fucks trying to attack the president on some bullshit duirng a pandemic. Can't take a break from your circlejerk fucking orgy of biased partisanship fuckery\n\n\"Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019 They go, \u2018Oh, not good, not good.\u2019 They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa, they can\u2019t even count. No they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t count their votes.\n\nOne of my people came up to me and said, \u2018Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they\u2019ve been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning, they lost, it\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We\u2019re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\"", "created_utc": 1584480686.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fks23jy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fkcwca", "parent_id": "t1_fkrzqar", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fks23jy", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fkcwca/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fks23jy/"}
