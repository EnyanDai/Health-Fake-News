Dozens of accusations of sexual assault including an admission on tape? Calling Nazis very fine people? Firing Comey and other clear examples of obstruction? Almost starting a full fledged war with Iran? The attempted transgender military ban? Characterizing the media as the enemy of the people? Inspiring right-wing terrorists? The longest government shutdown in US history over nothing? Fucking being impeached only for there to be a kangaroo court in the Senate?", "created_utc": 1588625856.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fphqbmp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t3_gddv33", "score": 42, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fphqbmp", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fphqbmp/"}
