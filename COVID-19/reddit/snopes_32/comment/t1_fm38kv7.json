Here is the correct timeline\n\nEmergency Declarations for H1N1\n\nThe first U.S. infection of the novel type of influenza was identified in California on April 15, 2009.\nOn April 25, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern.\nThe next day, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency. (It was repeatedly renewed.)\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first fatality from the outbreak days later, on April 29.\nWHO declared H1N1 a pandemic on June 11.\nBy Oct. 5, an H1N1 vaccine was ready and the first doses were given in the U.S.\nObama weeks later declared a national emergency on Oct. 24, 2009. The CDC director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said at the time that millions of people had been infected in the U.S. and more than 1,000 had died.\n\nEmergency Declarations for COVID-19\n\nThe CDC confirmed the first case of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., in Washington state, on Jan. 21.\nWHO declared a global public health emergency of international concern days later on Jan. 30.\nThe next day, on Jan. 31, HHS declared a public health emergency for the U.S. in response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease.\nWeeks later, on Feb. 29, the first U.S. death attributed to the virus was reported.\nWHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.\nOn March 13, Trump declared a national emergency. As of March 12, there had been 40 reported deaths in the U.S.\n\nTrump has also not shut down the economy. He has offered guidance and 42 governors have shut down their states. If Trump was responsible for that action, DeSantis in Florida would have issued a stay at home order. \n\nI have repeatedly given this admin credit for changing course and starting to do the correct thing, but it\u2019s simply a fact that there were early and disastrous missteps. On Feb 5th HSS requested 2 billion for PPE. Trump cut that budget by 75%. Now we have a national shortage. That\u2019s an undeniable fact.\n\nEdit - [LINK](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/flawed-comparison-on-coronavirus-h1n1-emergency-timelines/) \n\nhere\u2019s a link to where I found those timelines.", "created_utc": 1585715768.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm38kv7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fsru23", "parent_id": "t1_fm37lgq", "score": -8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm38kv7", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fsru23/no_trump_never_called_coronavirus_a_hoax/fm38kv7/"}
