But believe it or not, Trump is smarter than most of the people who hate him actually think. How he managed to become POTUS wasnt just due to his previous power or his wealth but because of how he played the system/the people. His rating has been pretty high/stable in the last few months. I try to be skeptical of everyone, politicians and the masses. Just because a massive amount(probably the majority) of people have similar views of Trump/politics doesnt mean theyre right. They just have their own biased views when it comes to their outlook on life, which completely blinds them. Lots of people who hate Trump arent generally critical thinkers/intelligent people. Yeah trump has shown instances of idiocy and lack of respect for others. That should not discredit every accomplishment he may have made. The negative things anyone does in life usually is what people see in others, rather than the good.", "created_utc": 1584569137.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkvh6b7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka1ke", "parent_id": "t1_fkt6ust", "score": -1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkvh6b7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka1ke/trump_who_has_previously_called_the_coronavirus_a/fkvh6b7/"}
