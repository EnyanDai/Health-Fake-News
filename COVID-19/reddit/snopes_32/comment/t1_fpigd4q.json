They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.*\n\nHis first comment where he really didn't specifically say that it was a media hoax.\n\n\u201cA virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn\u2019t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes and the Democrats\u2019 single talking point, and you see it, is that it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s fault, right? It\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, just things that happened.\u201d\n\nThis might make you appear to be correct, but notice how he didn't SPECIFCALLY SAY THAT as you claim he did. His first comment was very easy to see him call it a hoax...then his second comment where he said a bunch of wrong shit that also does imply he might think it is a media hoax. My point is, he very much so was not specific and he very much left it up to others to read into it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I saw your message for a second...blocking me means I dont get to actually read it.
