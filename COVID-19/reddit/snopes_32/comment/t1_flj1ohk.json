They say it's not fair to say Trump called it a hoax. This is the full quote that they say clears that up:\n\n>\u201cCoronavirus. They\u2019re politicizing it.  We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019 \u2018Oh, nothing, nothing.\u2019 They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue.\u00a0... And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nYou tell me. *What* exactly is he calling a hoax? The claim he's not doing anything? Because the rest of the ad has all the quotes you need proving *that* interpretation too - assuming his lack of actions wasn't enough.\n\nThis is bullshit and we have got to stop taking it.
