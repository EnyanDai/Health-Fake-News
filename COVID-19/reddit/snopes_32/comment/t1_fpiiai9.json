He didn\u2019t ban all flights from China so that\u2019s a lie! And  he\u2019s the president who ignored the warnings for over 8 weeks from many sources no one else! And they did sound the alarm Kamala  Harris asked why no one from the trump administration showed up to answer questions about the trump administration response to it on Feb 12!  The markets grew at the same rate and path on a graph that they were before he took office so that\u2019s a lie too! And jobs were falling before covid too! Typical trump supporter syndrome who refuses facts and what actually happened and instead believes all the lies dear leader spews out of his mouth and Twitter! How come trump incurred so much debt in a bull market when it should have decreased or stopped accruing? Because he was artificially propping up the market demanding lower interest rates to make it look better then it was! Trumps a failure and he\u2019s responsible for the largest loss in the history of the stock market, the highest unemployment in the history of America! Trump cut funding for the CDC and dismantled the pandemic response department no one else! Trump refused to listen to all the warnings and follow the pandemic response handbook no one else! Trump refused to enact and use the defense production act no one else! Trumps the President no one else and it\u2019s his job as President and he failed! You can\u2019t blame the others for not doing what only the president can do!", "created_utc": 1588641480.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fpiiai9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t1_fpihf2q", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1588641735.0, "name": "t1_fpiiai9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fpiiai9/"}
