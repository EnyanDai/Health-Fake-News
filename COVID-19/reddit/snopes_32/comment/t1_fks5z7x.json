Was it trump that brought this country to this point ALONE?\n\nSave me the ethical standards for presidents for when it actually applies. The charade of ethical standards in the presidencies is a flimsy one. So much is continually coming out about how past presidents acted behind close doors. Racist comments, sexual harassment, and truth about blatant lies they espoused to protect high profile individuals.\n\nDo you really think presidents were ethical before Trump? Or was it Obama that was the only ethical president in terms of his behavior? Or was it just the media covering for presidents to give the appearance of decency?\n\nIf President Trump decided to be \"ethical\" when he transitioned from candidate Trump to president Trump, do you think that would have stopped the endless slander against him from the media? Do you forget how the media gave him billions of dollars of negative media ONLY because they made BANK off of it and didnt think it would help trump.\n\nWas the media going to stop pulling any punch they could get in on him just because he became president and played nicely? Or do you think he should have fell on a sword of decency while the media ripped him apart to regain their power.", "created_utc": 1584482991.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fks5z7x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka5wb", "parent_id": "t1_fks4n3n", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584483396.0, "name": "t1_fks5z7x", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka5wb/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fks5z7x/"}
