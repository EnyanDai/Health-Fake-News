You know that, right? Coronavirus. They're politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs, you say, 'How's President Trump doing?', 'Oh, nothing, nothing.' They have no clue, they don't have any clue. \n\n\"Oh nothing, nothing\".... as in, the media is saying Trump is doing \"nothing\" about Covid.\n\nAnd they are STILL hoaxing us to this day with fake overblown stories.\n\nYes.  This is serious.  Yes.  I think we should avoid public places and try to flatten the curve...but some of the media is inducing unnecessary PANIC and unnecessary demonization of the President.  And I'm sick of it.\n\nIt's absolutely disgusting what the media has done.  They have made us mistrust them totally.  Even more than we did before.\n\nEven the subreddit that the admins are directing people too is a shitty, anti-Trump circle-jerk that upvoted the World Socialist Worker website to the top of the subreddit last week like anyone gives a crap what the socialist workers think of this.\n\nI started /r/MyCorona19 as a place to simply put non-political informative articles and the comment sections immediately LOCK so that a bunch of whiners can't come in and say, \"Because of Drumpf people are drinking fish medicine!\"  Just a place to try to place some SANE stories that we come across where people can just get an overview and some information minus all the crap.", "created_utc": 1585714584.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fm372n5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fsru23", "parent_id": "t1_fm35o5z", "score": 23, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fm372n5", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/fsru23/no_trump_never_called_coronavirus_a_hoax/fm372n5/"}
