They're called the states. Same with the EPA and FDA. How about the welfare system? Federal usurpation of authorities not granted them in the enumerated powers. We have 17 intelligence agencies, most of whom do many the same things, and don't share much info with each other, not to mention the illegal spying on Americans part. PHow many Federal Law Enforcement agencies are there? How many are in the Constitution? The National Debt has not ballooned under Trump. It has certainly gone up, but ballooning is what happened under Bush, followed by Obama. And who creates spending bills? Sure as hell isn't the Executive branch. \n\nI am all about fiscal responsibility, but lay blame where it belongs. How many years has Congress gone with the CRs and such, as opposed to an actual budget bill? How long has granting people largesse been an election strategy? Trump is trying to make things work, and cut down on the levels of waste and abuse every agency in the country has, and he's the problem? Of that whole list of agencies you listed, trying to get something I already explained in a previous answer, how many HAVEN'T been involved in something corrupt in the past decade?\n\nAs for the CDC, do you think spending hundreds of millions on new offices, visitor centers, and expensive furniture is a correct way to spend their budget? How about the absolute crap they've been studying? Things like what happens when we give monkeys alcohol, why some lesbians are fat, and the scourge of \"gun disease\". Let's face it, when you give an agency basically a blank check, they're going to abuse the ahit out of it.", "created_utc": 1583246054.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjd5e84", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fbfemw", "parent_id": "t1_fjcjlio", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj2e", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjd5e84", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/conservatives/comments/fbfemw/media_claims_trump_called_coronavirus_a_hoax/fjd5e84/"}
