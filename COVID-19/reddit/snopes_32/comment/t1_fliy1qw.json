Here\u2019s my question to you: why did trump mention people getting better? What is he trying to communicate to the American people?  \n>  \n>Reminder: the opening post is about trump repeatedly not taking this seriously enough until it was very late in the game.\n\nDude. I have no idea what the problem is. This was called a mild disease for most people by the IDSA.\n\nsee for Your self:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"The VAST MAJORITY of coronavirus pattens have a VERY MILD respiratory infection much like most of us would think of as a COLD.\u201d  \n>  \n>Dr. Kelly Cawcutt tweeted by IDSA- Infectious Diseases Society of America  \n>  \n>[https://twitter.com/DrJRMarcelin/status/1235752221578588164](https://twitter.com/DrJRMarcelin/status/1235752221578588164)  \n>  \n>If you want to hear the words spoken yourself its in the 1st minute of video.\n\nBased on that one can say that you can calm the public down by telling them that most of you will be at most reset experiencing a cold. What's the big deal? Why is that a problem?\n\nYou're also dropping the rest of the context. Did Donald Trump say that everything else is all right and we don't have to do anything? Why would he be closing the borders then? \n\nSo making this one point about how a lot of people will get better in the middle of everything else he said is mainly to calm people down. It is 100% accurate. 100%", "created_utc": 1585193559.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fliy1qw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fly2x9", "parent_id": "t1_flioagg", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cr3o", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fliy1qw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fly2x9/what_is_your_opinion_of_the_coronavirus_video/fliy1qw/"}
