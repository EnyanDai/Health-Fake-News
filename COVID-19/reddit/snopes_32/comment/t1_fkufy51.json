The peak growth of Chinese factory jobs was under George W. Bush. Obama made no policy shift preferential to Chinese trade. He was a huge proponent of TPP, which was a trade agreement essentially designed to fuck China over, and focus our trade on the rest of the Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations, as a way to peacefully wrest economic control from China, but it failed.     \n\nBiden is a dumpster fire, yeah, but if your best idea is \"your guy is as shitty as mine,\" then I'm incredibly sorry. Damn near every Democrat under 40  wants Bernie, and a massive amount of Biden support comes from Republicans voting in primaries.
