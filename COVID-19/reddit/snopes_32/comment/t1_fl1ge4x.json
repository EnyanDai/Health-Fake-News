Why did he stop travel with a global superpower if he wasn\u2019t taking it seriously?\n\n*Are you aware that we have over 15000 cases in the US as of today in spite of Trump\u2019s travel ban? And even though Trump said \u201canyone who wants a test can get one\u201d we still have people with symptoms being turned away without a test because there are so few tests available.*\n\nThis seem like an attempt to move the goal posts away from the discussion of whether or not Trump was taking the virus seriously prior to March. In making this shift, are you acknowledging that Trump was in fact taking this virus seriously earlier than you previously thought?\n\n*Shouldn\u2019t the fact that we still today cannot test everyone with symptoms give you pause before you praise Trump\u2019s handling of this pandemic?*\n\nAgain, does this have to do with when Trump began taking this seriously?
