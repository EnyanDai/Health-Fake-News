Here are facts that we knew: \n\nChina was having a horrible outbreak bad enough for the gov to literally weld people into their homes.\n\nWe knew there was *asymptomatic* transmission, probably the scariest and most dangerous part of this whole thing. \n\nWe knew by logic and inference that since there is so much travel going on in the world and China that the former facts are just a recipe for disaster. And look where we are now. \n\nMy general point is this. I\u2019m holding our highest office to the highest standard. Millions are going to die in the United States by the time this is over. And many people are going to lose a year or more of their lives living in lockdown in their homes. These facts alone are enough for me to decide that president and his administration did not do enough to stop it. It\u2019s really that simple. I\u2019m not accepting this and what is going to happen as normal or ok. We can\u2019t ever let this happen again.
