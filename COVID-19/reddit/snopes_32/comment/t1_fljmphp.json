I'm sure the comments were crafted so that his disgusting, dumbass supporters would believe the virus was a hoax and blame the Democrats for everything, and some Democrats would fall into the trap of claiming he said the virus was a hoax, which he could then use as more proof that he's the victim of a Democratic hoax.\n\nThis is the president of the United States we're talking about. A disgusting, lying sociopath. At one point, I thought the high road was the right approach with him, but it's pretty clear that he's an existential threat to our values, our health and our country, so I say throw everything at him. If that means we get in the mud with him and knock him out with his own tactics, then so be it.", "created_utc": 1585219178.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fljmphp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fp1wwz", "parent_id": "t1_flj28dg", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn70", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1585219492.0, "name": "t1_fljmphp", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/democrats/comments/fp1wwz/president_trumps_reelection_campaign_is/fljmphp/"}
