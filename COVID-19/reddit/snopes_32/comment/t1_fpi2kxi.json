I'm not a vegetarian or vegan by any means, but I wouldn't really care if I couldn't buy meat for a while (month, a year?). I guess I'm not worried that meat would never be available again... and I'm really hoping we won't ever need to start hunting for meat... but I can't see it ever coming to that, at least not in most parts of America. Right? Other than the jobs that are affected by shortages realated to meat... are people actually worried what they will do without meat to eat? How many people actually eat meat everyday? I hope they realize that eating meat often  isn't entirely necessary. I would be more worried if canned goods and nonperishables became scarce, but is that even possible? Maybe there is a kind of silver lining to this unfortunate mess. Better diets and better overall health. Less pollution. Better social awareness and consideration of others. Better preparedness and the development of new systems, and new technologies, to improve medicine.
