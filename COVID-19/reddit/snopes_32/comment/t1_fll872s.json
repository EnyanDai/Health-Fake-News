The criticism was dead on!\n\nWe should run with this, because it makes the Democratic opposition look intelligent and even prescient and makes him look like a bigger idiot for his botched response!\n\nI'd love to see somebody do an ad or video that shows Dem politicians saying what he should have been doing or was he did wrong and then show his rant over the increasing number of cases.\n\n>**Now  the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right?  Coronavirus. They\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You  say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019 They go, \u2018Oh, not good, not good.\u2019  They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue.** They can\u2019t even  count their votes in Iowa, they can\u2019t even count. No they can\u2019t. They  can\u2019t count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, \u2018Mr.  President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn\u2019t  work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment  hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they  tried it over and over, they\u2019ve been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all  turning, they lost, it\u2019s all turning. **Think  of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did  something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We\u2019re 15 people \\[cases of  coronavirus infection\\] in this massive country.
