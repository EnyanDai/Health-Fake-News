It would be bernie's responsibility to make concessions and quell fears in order to get the moderate wing of the party on your side because like I said, YOU NEED BOTH. I don't put the blame on the voters and ask them to hold their nose and vote for the lesser of two evils, I believe bernie was wrong not to massage the fears of moderates and it lost him the primary, I believe Biden is wrong for doing the same things to progressives and it will lose him the general*. The voters don't owe bernie a single thing, they were on his side because they felt like he was fighting for their interests. And in the same vein they don't owe Biden anything and it's Biden's responsibility to make concessions and massage fears in order to get them on board, just like it was for bernie.\n\nEdit: at least would have lost him the general before the economy tanked. Now I think he'll win not because progressives on board but because Republicans aren't as fired up as they were and you once again don't need progressives to build a winning coalition", "created_utc": 1584477017.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkrvrut", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka1ke", "parent_id": "t1_fkruaqc", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkrvrut", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka1ke/trump_who_has_previously_called_the_coronavirus_a/fkrvrut/"}
