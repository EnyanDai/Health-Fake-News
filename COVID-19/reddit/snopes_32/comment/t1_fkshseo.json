You know that, right? Coronavirus. They\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019 They go, \u2018Oh, not good, not good.\u2019 They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa, they can\u2019t even count. No they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t count their votes.\n\n>One of my people came up to me and said, \u2018Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they\u2019ve been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning, they lost, it\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.\n\nSo again, using the full context, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s referring to the Democrats\u2019 politicization of the pandemic as a \u201choax.\u201d For example, a New York Times columnist dubbing it the \u201cTrumpvirus\u201d early on. That is the sort of rhetoric he\u2019s referring to as a politicization.", "created_utc": 1584490393.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkshseo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fkcwca", "parent_id": "t1_fkrznzl", "score": 16, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkshseo", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/fkcwca/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fkshseo/"}
