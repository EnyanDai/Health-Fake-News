I would think it obvious that he's not calling the virus itself a hoax? Even in the ad they have audio of him talking about the existence of the virus but drastically downplaying the risk. \n\n>One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear. When you have 15 people and within a couple of days is gonna be down to close to zero. We really think we've done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum.\n\nSure - that's from 30 seconds later in his rambling, but he's clearly claiming he's got everything under control and the virus will just disappear. I don't see what is even slightly misleading about the ad. If we had no context and someone just listened to that portion, I'm pretty sure they would agree that he thinks warnings about the spread and severity are 'fake news' or a hoax.", "created_utc": 1585238357.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flkckg4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fp1wwz", "parent_id": "t1_flj4erh", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn70", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flkckg4", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/democrats/comments/fp1wwz/president_trumps_reelection_campaign_is/flkckg4/"}
