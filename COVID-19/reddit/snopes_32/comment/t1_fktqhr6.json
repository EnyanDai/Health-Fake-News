The full quote was copied and pasted to me below. The Snopes article is wrong. You can't decipher what Trump was talking about, so I'm no longer comfortable defending any of it.\n\nHe's right though. Trump never called the virus itself a hoax, and claiming he did is giving these guys a very easy \"win\" (as in they can just say we're spreading fake news and tune us out.) \n\n>During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying \"this is their new hoax.\" During the speech he also seemed to downplay the severity of the outbreak, comparing it to the common flu.\n\nI mean he's still lying. His response was weak as shit. But he has never called the virus itself a hoax and saying he did is not true.
