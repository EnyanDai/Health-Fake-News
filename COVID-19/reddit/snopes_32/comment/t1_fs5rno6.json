Instead he shot himself in the foot and had to insist he knows best and here we are (for better or for worse given its an election year).\n\nA huge part of his initial support/campaign was that he wasn\u2019t a politician. He was a businessman who was gonna put the best possible people in charge and let them essentially do all the work. What has he done? Lol. He\u2019s fired all the competent people, replaced them with complete jokes, and makes ALL decisions himself. All terrible decisions.
