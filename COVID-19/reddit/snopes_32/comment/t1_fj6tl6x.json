There are multiple federal agencies and groups that are redundant. There are like 17 different agencies for Intelligence, and we see how that's worked out. I'm NOT saying that there are 17 groups that do what the CDC does, but if you think for a second that they, NIH, or NHSC don't have bloat and waste, you aren't paying attention. Look no further than the things they were doing during the last Administration. Is conducting research on \"gun violence\" what the CDC is supposed to be doing? That study used tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, and was ridiculous and political to the point of absurdity. Then there are all the studies they have conducted on the sexual proclivities of fruit flies, why monkeys throw poop, plunking down hundreds of millions on state of the art offices, fitness gyms, saunas, gravity chairs, and all other sorts of crap that is just a massive waste of money. Don't sit there and act like all the groups are somehow exceeding ROI for every dollar of our money they get.
