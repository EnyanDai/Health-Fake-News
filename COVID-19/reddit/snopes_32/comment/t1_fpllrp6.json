The second sentence of your second paragraph starts with \"We\"? Who is that referring to? \n\nThe way I see it, different states and different cities have different needs. Its not a one size fits all solution. So you need to be more specific. Also, you're not an expert. So you're not in a position to tell people to wear masks or not. You're just a guy. Be humble.

Neither should you. \n\nI think you'll do much better if you isolate your argument to a specific state or city.
