The WHO couldn't go tagging China as the data manipulators that they were without proof but as soon as they had proof, they publicly warned the world of the threat. Reality is that in closed door meetings they were sharing this information long before it was released to the PUBLIC. \n\nUS intelligence services already had that info and more and honestly anyone with half a brain knows that China and Russia are going to lie to the world to make themselves appear better. Chinese doctors went missing when they spoke out and Russian doctors are taking trips out windows when they speak candidly about what they are actually seeing.\n\nNot directly pertaining to the WHO but one of the great talking points are the COVID deniers in the US that say \"it's not that bad\" but then want to point to China and say \"it was way worse than reported, you can't trust them!\" So it's not a threat in US but it was way worse than reported in China?
