Somehow, they're expected to retract false or misleading statements but the leader of the country is not. That's not the same standard.\n\n> But it seems like we are getting stuck with people injecting their own personal or political views on the topic, when at least for me, my focus is purely on the media criticism side of things - at least in this sub. \n\nSure. Maybe, don't criticize the media when they self-correct? Criticize them at the time of the original statement.\n\n> My initial, broader point remains the same - that he is attacked by the media when it is warranted, as well as when it is not.\n\nAgreed.\n\n> My fear is that always beating the same drum will lessen the impact in the times when it is legitimate, because it can be hard to tell the difference the two since the media reacts the same way no matter what he says or does. \n\nAgreed.\n\n> And that makes it easier for him to simply wave his hands and say \u201cfake news,\u201d even when it\u2019s not. \n\nAgreed.", "created_utc": 1585093619.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flexnce", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fnv8fy", "parent_id": "t1_fletyv1", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3a6w2", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flexnce", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/media_criticism/comments/fnv8fy/washington_post_reporter_has_apologized_for_and/flexnce/"}
