He called tha Democrats using the virus as a political attack on his ineptitude as a president was \"their new hoax\" after the \"impeachment hoax\" failed.\n\nEDIT:\n\nListen. I'm not a trump supporter. I hate trump. There are plenty of actual sound bites you can use, actual fucked up things he said that you can hate on him about. \n\nI'm not saying trump handled the pandemic well. I'm not saying the Democrats weren't right to attack him on how he handled it. \n\nI'm simply saying, this is fake news, he never called it a hoax, that's just a fact. \n\nSo don't start telling me about how shitty he is of a president. I know he's trash and I can't believe you American idiots elected him in the first place. \n\nBut fake news is fake news. Just because trump is a piece of shit, that doesn't mean peddling fake news is right.", "created_utc": 1588629092.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fphwhsg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gddv33", "parent_id": "t3_gddv33", "score": -17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1588632483.0, "name": "t1_fphwhsg", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/gddv33/trump_admits_he_was_briefed_on_coronavirus_before/fphwhsg/"}
