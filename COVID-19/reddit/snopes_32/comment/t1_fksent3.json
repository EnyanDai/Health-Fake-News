Let's watch. Let's just watch. Very dishonest people. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They're politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs, you say, \"How's President Trump doing?\", \"Oh, nothing, nothing.\" They have no clue, they don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa, they can't even count. No, they can't. They can count their votes.

That was on a perfect conversation.They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they've been doing it since she got in. It's all turning, they lost. It's all turning, think of it, think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that's been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\"\n\n[That's from a political rally he held February 28th of 2020](https://youtu.be/NE4ugoCY_E4). Check out minutes 4 through 5 for the part I quoted. Maybe your own biases are getting in the way of seeing the President for what he actually is? An incapable leader, an incompetent leader who never takes responsibility for anything. And if your own biases aren't getting in the way so you can, paraphrasing what you said, believe something about him to make it true and you can see him for what he is, maybe you're here spreading misinformation intentionally?", "created_utc": 1584488369.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fksent3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fka5wb", "parent_id": "t1_fks80en", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fksent3", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/fka5wb/trump_says_he_knew_coronavirus_was_a_pandemic/fksent3/"}
