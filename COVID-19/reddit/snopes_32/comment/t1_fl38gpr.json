I think leaving shutdowns and local responses to the states is preferable to the federal, and even then it\u2019s been too heavy handed.\n\nFair! I don't mind it. I wouldn't have minded Trump actually saying at the forefront of this that he was doing that either. I think my comment was more that when this started it seemed like states were shooting at the hip about what to do, and in some cases cities have to be the ones enacting things. If the Federal government, or Trump specifically, had publically said they will advise the states specifically on what to do based on severity I think that would make sense. As far as I know that didn't happen.\n\n>I think the quarantines should be more tailored and less general. For a governor Wolf, as an example, to shut down an entire state (PA) when the state has had 1 death and most rural counties haven\u2019t even had cases... the damage to the economy, the negative outcome and will be more wide spread and more impactful to people then the virus could ever hope to be. (All the while allowing flights to come in from Seattle to Philly and Pittsburgh, I might add.)\n\nThe whole point of this virus is to enact stuff like this at a time where it looks like you are overreacting.\n\nDue to the fact you can be an asymptomatic carrier, have the virus for days before developing symptoms, or have a very mild case of the virus to where you don't think you have it, many people will be in public with the virus and not even realize it. \n\nWhy is that an issue? Well it's because the [R0 factor](https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number) of COVID-19 is somewhere between 2-2.5. Aka for every 1 COVID-19 carrier they will spread the disease to 2-2.5 people over the diseases lifetime. The flu has a R0 factor of 1.3.\n\nThis also tells us that this virus, if we do nothing about it, would be very impactful. Having that high of an R0 factor means a lot of the country would get this thing if we did nothing.\n\n>I don\u2019t think the response has been commensurate to the crisis at all. We\u2019re compounding our problems, making huge, rippling, damaging and unprecedented steps based on new and incomplete info.\n\nI don't really know what more you want to see? Disease experts are doing experiments on the disease every day. Stuff like R0 factor are pretty well discerned at this point. I'll trust the experts on this one.\n\n>South Korea and even Washington state, our own epicenter of the Chinese virus, are on the downward curve after a month and after much less damage to their economy.\n\nAsia as a whole was much better prepared for this due to the last viruses that destroyed their corner of the globe (stuff like MERS). [South Korea has seen success due to their herculean testing effort.](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success) They actually hunt down clusters and isolate them. Even as I say this they recently found a cluster in Seoul and it seems the case # is rising so we will see if they can continue to contain it. \n\nWashington State also has, I believe by far, done the most testing per capita in the country so far mainly due to Wash U doing non CDC approved tests.\n\nI'll leave you with this...currently in the US we are already seeing Nurses, Doctors, and even Governors (Cuomo) ask for PPE gear (gloves, masks, etc) only a few weeks after this really started to get serious in the US. Even an optimistic guess at the peak of this in the US is still ~2 weeks away and we are already out of gear that protects our hospital workers.\n\nFrom what I've seen experts say, the main fear isn't actually the death rate of the disease in normal conditions. The main fear is that **hospitals will be overrun**. I'm sure you're heard of flattening the curve?\n\nThe media/public focusing on the death rate is a terrible way to frame why this disease is bad.\n\nThe real reason this disease is bad is:\n\n1. It's new, so we don't have a vaccine.\n2. It spreads quickly.\n3. Many people host the virus without symptoms, or mild symptoms.\n4. It's hospitalization rate is much higher than the flu.\n\nCombine those all together, and if we don't atleast slow it down (aka flatten the curve, which I'm sure you've heard of) shit can get dire very quick at hospitals. Dire conditions at hospitals mean more deaths. \n\nSo, is quarantining an entire state a radical move? Sure. I think this is a time to do it though, considering.
