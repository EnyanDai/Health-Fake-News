I do not condone any religion or skin color. Didn't you say its mostly Muslims? Lol and your the one that flammed me first for living in LaLa land. Im not gonna take that kind of crap talk when its not true. Im explaining my life as I live it currently with the lockdown. Not what some muslims are doing. If they want war with the local police and get stomped, so be it. But its a stupid game when something as dangerous as the Covid-19 running around. They will get locked up anyway. The problem with our \"thugs\" here in France, is that they had no proper education for the most of them. So the popo is the enemie here you understand?? What a stupid logic.\n\nFrench is my second language. I am American, but have dual nationalities. French mom, American dad. So yes my typing sucks in french, but screw it, you understood me and that is what counts.", "created_utc": 1584590045.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkwe828", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fl0wzx", "parent_id": "t1_fkwc5t2", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkwe828", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0wzx/advice_from_france_to_avoid_ibuprofen_for_covid19/fkwe828/"}
