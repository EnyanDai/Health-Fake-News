I\u2019ve been prepped since January and stopped back in mid February when there was still tons of food and product left.  This isn\u2019t my first time preparing for a distaster so I\u2019m always trying to pay attention to what\u2019s going on in the world. Part of me wants to act like it\u2019s fine to get through my day quarantined at home with the family but then I turn on the tv and it\u2019s literally reruns on our local daytime news show because of the limit on groups of 10 of more congregating. You\u2019re right - it looks normal outside and the weather is finally warming up, some of the neighborhood kids play ball during the day to get outside but you also know that there\u2019s a tsunami coming and you\u2019re praying your life jacket is tied tight enough to float to the surface when it hits. I\u2019m sorry you have to work in uncertain conditions- I wouldn\u2019t blame you one bit for walking away. Are people around you wearing masks yet? We are still being told they don\u2019t help (which is ridiculous) but then I see videos from Europe and everyone is wearing one.", "created_utc": 1584583469.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkw4t3a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fl0wzx", "parent_id": "t1_fkw44ci", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkw4t3a", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0wzx/advice_from_france_to_avoid_ibuprofen_for_covid19/fkw4t3a/"}
