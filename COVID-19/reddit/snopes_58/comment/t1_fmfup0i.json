Sometimes a triptan in it's own isn't quite enough for me.  Also do keep up with your paracetamol anyway.  You may not feel the benefit of one dose but if you take it regularly as indicated on the box, you may find it lessens the pain a bit.  Painkillers like paracetamol have a cumulative effect, just dont be tempted to take more than the recommended dose as it's easy to overdo paracetamol. \n\nOtherwise that list posted above me looks really good.  I also have a cefaly device but I'd only recommend that if you've tried a tens machine before and found it works for you as, although it was worth it for me, it was super expensive.  Before I had that I just used to have a pile of gel packs.in the freezer that i could use on rotation whe the pain hit.\n\nHope you feel better soon!", "created_utc": 1586035228.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmfup0i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuy3zy", "parent_id": "t3_fuy3zy", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qr75", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmfup0i", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/migraine/comments/fuy3zy/i_need_your_advice_im_currently_living_in_france/fmfup0i/"}
