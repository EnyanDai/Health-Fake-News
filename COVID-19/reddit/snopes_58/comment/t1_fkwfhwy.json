I do not condone any religion or skin color. Didn't you say its mostly Muslims? Lol and your the one that flammed me first for living in LaLa land. \n\nIt wasn't me (check atleast the username before posting, that might help). Go solve this problem with him.\n\n>Im not gonna take that kind of crap talk when its not true. Im explaining my life as I live it currently with the lockdown. Not what some muslims are doing. If they want war with the local police and get stomped, so be it. But its a stupid game when something as dangerous as the Covid-19 running around. They will get locked up anyway. The problem with our \"thugs\" here in France, is that they had no proper education for the most of them. So the popo is the enemie here you understand?? What a stupid logic.\n\nMy problem with your comment is not your criticism of these thugs, it's that you singled out Arabs. Like I said, blacks are not all criminals, same for mexicans. It's not about if you're white, black or arab, your education has nothing to do with it. Your race, origin or religion doesn't define who you are. It's that simple, how can you not understand that point ? \n\n>French is my second language. I am American, but have dual nationalities. French mom, American dad. So yes my typing sucks in french, but screw it, you understood me and that is what counts.\n\nThat's awesome. Like I said, I don't care how good your french is. I was more bothered by the content of your comment than its form.", "created_utc": 1584591027.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkwfhwy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fl0wzx", "parent_id": "t1_fkwe828", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkwfhwy", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0wzx/advice_from_france_to_avoid_ibuprofen_for_covid19/fkwfhwy/"}
