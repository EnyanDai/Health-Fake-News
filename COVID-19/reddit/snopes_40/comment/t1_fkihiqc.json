You never, ever, ever, EVER predict someone's death, and she was flat out wrong on a murder case, as I recall.  Tore the family to pieces.  I saw her practice numerous times, and her arrogance was mind-boggling.  My own teacher of 50 years experience disliked her intensely.\n\nI also have my B.S. in molecular biology, so I am very well aware that yes, she was going to be right eventually.  Pandemics sweep through every 30 years or so in various parts of the world.  So this was not a hard prediction.  And no, it's not going to disappear--we will eventually develop herd immunity, and hopefully, get a vaccine developed against it, but it's here to stay.  That's what viruses and human immune response does.\n\nI'm the first one to believe that REAL mediumistic input can be very useful, and a great solace to people, but manipulating them when you don't know is absolutely inappropriate.
