Just like 99% of her predictions.\n\nCorona virus isn\u2019t a severe pneumonia. She\u2019s actually describing SARS more than Covid-19. Doctors also know how to treat it. Viruses can\u2019t be cured but the symptoms can be suppressed. What gets me is she says \u2018the lungs AND bronchial tubes.\u2019 That is such a dumbass thing to say and it shows that she has no idea what she\u2019s talking about. At least do some research on what the lungs are before you go out and publish such a bullshit prediction. It\u2019s almost an arrogant thing to do.\n\nReally stupid people will see that Kim Kardashian posted this on social media and blindly jump on board with it. Let\u2019s all remember the countless predictions about aliens exposing themselves, Atlantis, HIV cures, common cold cures, etc. when trying to take her seriously. \n\nIf you want a good laugh, look up her more domestic predictions. She more or less predicts that we are living like the Jetsons \u2018in around\u2019 2020.", "created_utc": 1585496410.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "flu6pdk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fiiobf", "parent_id": "t1_fkigl1w", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjxn", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_flu6pdk", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Paranormal/comments/fiiobf/sylvia_browne_predicted_the_coronavirus/flu6pdk/"}
