It\u2019s a pretty interesting way to consider reconstructing how our government functions.\n\nExcerpt from book, \u201cEnd of Days\u201d by Sylvia Browne\n\n\u201cThe year 2020 will mark the end of the U.S. presidency and the executive branch of the government. Let\u2019s just say the American public will finally be fed up by then and leave it at that.\n\nThe legislative branch will essentially absorb the responsibilities of the executive branch, with a streamlined body of elected representatives, an equal number from each state, forming the new legislature, which will be known simply as the Senate. The \u201cparty\u201d system of Democrats, Republicans, Independents, et al., will un-complicate itself into Liberals and Conservatives, who will debate and vote on each proposed bill and law in nationally televised sessions.\n\nRequirements for Senate candidates will be stringent and continuously monitored. For example, senators will be prohibited from having any past or present salaried position with any company that has ever had or might ever have a professional or contractual connection to federal, state, or local government, and each senator must submit to random drug and alcohol testing throughout his or her term.\nThe long-term effects of this reorganized government and closely examined body of lawmakers will be a return of legislative accountability and public trust, and state\ngovernments will follow suit no later than 2024 by becoming smaller mirror images of the national Senate.\n\nAmong the laws that will be enacted during the Senate\u2019s first six-year term will be:\n\u2022 the flat tax\n\u2022 tax bonuses for those with careers in the arts, education, law enforcement, and public service\n\u2022 national observance of all major holidays celebrated by all major religions, as well as a Day of Remembrance for Holocaust survivors, victims, and their descendants\n\u2022 \u201cneutering\u201d of all male and female pedophiles proved guilty by irrefutable evidence as a mandated part of their prison sentence\n\u2022 a public health system\n\u2022 driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, even on the first offense, will result in mandated inpatient rehab and detox, and the immediate seizure and auctioning of the vehicle to defray the rehab and detox expenses.\u201d", "created_utc": 1584405576.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkpakyh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_feqv93", "parent_id": "t3_feqv93", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmhd", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkpakyh", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Psychic/comments/feqv93/in_2008_a_psychic_named_sylvia_browne_wrote_a/fkpakyh/"}
