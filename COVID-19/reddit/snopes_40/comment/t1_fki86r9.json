Treatment is mostly supportive and involves managing complications/secondary illnesses/concomitant illness. This is why it is critical to decrease the infection rate- as long as the number of infected people with severe illness is within the capacity of the medical system to handle - the mortality rate stays low.\n\n* predicting there will be an epidemic is a no brainer - most infectious disease professionals have been predicting epidemics for years. In any case here is my prediction: the polar ice is melting and this will release viruses that have been dormant for 10's of thousands of years so all novel to every living person. There will be more epidemics and pandemics. This is why we need to pour money and resources into our public health plans and pandemic plans.", "created_utc": 1584213917.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fki86r9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fiiobf", "parent_id": "t3_fiiobf", "score": 54, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjxn", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584214142.0, "name": "t1_fki86r9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Paranormal/comments/fiiobf/sylvia_browne_predicted_the_coronavirus/fki86r9/"}
