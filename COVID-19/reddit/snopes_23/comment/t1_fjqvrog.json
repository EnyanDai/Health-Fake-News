They asked world governments not to restrict travel from China, the cause of the worldwide outbreak today. Now that China has taken extreme measures to control the virus within its borders - and paid a heavy price for it - it would be perfectly justified for them to close their borders to the world to prevent it coming back in.\n\nIn hindsight, the WHO recommendation to not restrict travel from China was the best decision for nobody except China, which has now mitigated damage from the already-ongoing capital flight because the outbreak has spread. This is why the WHO is facing accusations of being shills for China, not because of lies, but because they've demonstrated a level of recklessness unbecoming of health professionals.", "created_utc": 1583578471.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjqvrog", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_femvc3", "parent_id": "t1_fjq6vob", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjqvrog", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/femvc3/who_says_theres_no_evidence_of_reinfected/fjqvrog/"}
