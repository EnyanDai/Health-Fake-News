I\u2019ve read about the few different strands/mutated strains - that\u2019s a fear of mine. It\u2019s going to run through us and experiment and mutate and I just hope it doesn\u2019t get to the point where we don\u2019t stand a chance. The reinfection reports I\u2019ve read were spooky. I remember reading one about a woman who has had it, recovered, and then started to have facial ticks before discovering that she had it again and some was found in her spinal fluid. But then again, it does sound far fetched but what do I know? On mobile so I can\u2019t fetch links right now. \n\nThe false positives are a bit spooky too, but there are processes I\u2019ve heard about that are definitely strange. For example: Go to a firehouse to get your test taken which takes a week to hear the results about? I get that all of the developments are new to be fair, but it\u2019s all so strange. I remember reading somewhere that it is believed the worlds general IQ will go up after all of this is over. Let\u2019s hope so. I can get a link for this later, YouTubers who have had their tests taken, recorded the whole process with the fire department.", "created_utc": 1587931546.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "foo333u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g85zjc", "parent_id": "t1_fom3zvu", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2si6m", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_foo333u", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/DeFranco/comments/g85zjc/who_warns_against_coronavirus_immunity_passports/foo333u/"}
