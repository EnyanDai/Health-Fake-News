There are antibodies formed when contagious and antibodies after recovery that have now been found to be different. They have found the contagious antibodies are only detectable once symptoms are setting in and shortly after recovery. They are finding the recovery antibodies but now finding they don't seem to stay around very long, meaning there probably is no developed immunity. \n  \nThe pin prick blood test that was supposed to detect one of the two antibody sets, very quickly, has now failed, proving to be unreliable. The RNA analysis machines are about $30,000 each and has to be run by a skilled technician. The next thing to find out if it is seasonal, which has been an assumption based on comparing it to the flu. Other than being a lot more contagious than the flu, these comparisons with the flu should be dropped.", "created_utc": 1586405355.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmv3s22", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fxl2lf", "parent_id": "t3_fxl2lf", "score": 21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhw9", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmv3s22", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/collapse/comments/fxl2lf/waityou_can_get_reinfected_with_the_coronavirus/fmv3s22/"}
