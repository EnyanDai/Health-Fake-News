Even if you test for common fragments and complete genome, you can get very limited answers. If you look at a gel electrophoresis, it tells you the size of the fragments, which is already really good, but doesn't tell much about the quality of the strands. You could do qPCR and see your amplification curves, but again, that just tells you if there was amplification, not much about the quality again.\n\nYou could do sequencing and that would be ideal, because you would know the size, composition and quality of the strands, but it is very expensive and can be very long.\n\nThe only real way to know for sure the infection and stage of infection would be to have a blood virus titer (if it even goes in the stream much) and have the exact infectious particles per volume of blood for exemple. Or doing cytometry on a nasalwash or a bronchoalveolar wash i would guess.\n\nPcr is very good and very fast, but we need to realize it has limitations. The only way to know more than a yes/no answer would be to perform tests at regular intervals and plot the progression of patients.\n\nLook at it another way, if you look at a picture of a child can you know anything about him in the future? No you only can know what is in the picture.
