Most of the people who get infected just have cold symptoms and get better.\n\nThe problem is that means that this spreads the same way a regular cold spreads, among a population that can't afford to care all that much if they get a minor sniffle. A population that doesn't really do anything about a minor sniffle.\n\nSo most people only get a cold, but that just means that the virus spreads to everybody who is susceptible enough that they actually developed pneumonia and died. And because this is a fairly strong virus, that is a scary large percentage of the people it infects.\n\nThis isn't a world Ender, but it is on par with the Spanish Flu and other big epidemics in terms of its potential to cause millions of deaths and disrupt shit.", "created_utc": 1582799484.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fiwre97", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fa92hl", "parent_id": "t1_fiwof3p", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fiwre97", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fa92hl/japanese_woman_reinfected_with_coronavirus_weeks/fiwre97/"}
