Which in math they only looked at 1.95% of people of a group of 10,700. Thats so small.\n\nThe first study was looking at if people have antibodies(test fails the minimal sample test, again a red flag for me), the second test they looked at the people who got reinfected. Those 207 people could have had false positives which is very likely. Testing cannot be 100% accurate. But if tests are 95% or 98% accurate that's still pretty good.Those 207 could have fallen into that 2% -5% fails that I used in my example.", "created_utc": 1587913626.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fon717g", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g85zjc", "parent_id": "t1_fomre4r", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2si6m", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fon717g", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/DeFranco/comments/g85zjc/who_warns_against_coronavirus_immunity_passports/fon717g/"}
