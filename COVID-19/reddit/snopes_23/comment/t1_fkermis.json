They do not state explicitly that this would be enough of a viral load to allow it to spread to other people but I'm assuming that is the implication.\n\nThis study investigated four patients (who were medical personnel) who had the disease with mild or moderate symptoms. After clinical recovery, the patients had tests to determine if the virus could be detected from their throat swabs. They all had TWO clean tests each, separated by at least one day.The patients then went home and quarantined for 5 days. After 5-13 days, they were again tested for the presence of the virus in their throat swabs, and all four patients came back positive.I'm guessing at this point, they thought this was odd/worrying, because they did THREE more tests in each patient over the next 4-5 days, and then another test using a kit from a different manufacturer. All these tests also came back positive, strongly suggesting the patients had the virus.\n\nPro of the study: They were really thorough when validating that these patients all showed presence of the virus in their throat swabs after recovery.\n\nCon?: As the authors state, maybe the negative results that they initially got before sending the patients home was false. However, they ran this test twice, on separate days, and all patients also had clinical symptoms of recovery - normal temperature for three days, respiratory symptoms gone, better conditions in the CT scan of their lungs. In addition, the kits used, and the person performing the test, was the same as when they tested the patients after recovery.", "created_utc": 1584119238.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkermis", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fi2cma", "parent_id": "t3_fi2cma", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkermis", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi2cma/they_survived_the_coronavirus_then_they_tested/fkermis/"}
