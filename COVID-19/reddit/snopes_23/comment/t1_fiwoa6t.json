Only a cold that keeps the first infected man in Italy, who is 38 years old, in hospital without signs of recovery after a week there, and much longer since he first got it. \n\nFor most people it might be just a cold (luckily), but for a big chunk of the population it might be fatal, and we still don't know enough about the virus to relax. \n\nMost governments are doing a terrible job, not even addressing their populations to explain how we can, if not stop it, at least slow down the spread of the disease so hospitals don't overcrow. \n\nIf most people had stayed home from the beginning of the crisis, the propagation of the virus would have been much much slower, and it could have even stopped there, but nooooo...  Let's tell people it is like a flu even though we still have no idea if it is or not! \nIf the situation is getting better in China it is precisely because most people have panicked and stayed home, cutting out the possibilities of transmission. How long does the rest of the world need yo wait to start applying the same measures? Do we need to see ourselves like they did before wr take such decision?", "created_utc": 1582794899.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fiwoa6t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fa92hl", "parent_id": "t1_fiwnb7s", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fiwoa6t", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/fa92hl/japanese_woman_reinfected_with_coronavirus_weeks/fiwoa6t/"}
