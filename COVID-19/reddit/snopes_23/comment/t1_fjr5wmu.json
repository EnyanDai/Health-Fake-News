Also no one is complaining about italy's response they seem to have stuffed it up totally. If you can go out buy a lot of canned food and a few good books and settle the fuck down.", "created_utc": 1583581866.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjr5wmu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_femvc3", "parent_id": "t3_femvc3", "score": -6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjr5wmu", "collapsed": true, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/femvc3/who_says_theres_no_evidence_of_reinfected/fjr5wmu/"}
