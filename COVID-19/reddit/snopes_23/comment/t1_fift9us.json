And writing is an art form that one may always learn from and improve at the creation of. Every Reddit commenter is an artist at work.\n\nSo when I see situations in which some minor thing (such as the placement of a comma, or the particular way I\u2019d constructed a sentence) led to *any* ambiguity, I think: \u201cHmm, that didn\u2019t work as I\u2019d thought it did.
