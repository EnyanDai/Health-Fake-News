If you get reinfected with the same disease it usually is one of three things:\n\n1. Your immune system memory was wiped. (Measles) Unlikely considering the timeframe and that something like this would've obviously been detected.\n\n2. Your immune system has serious issues, for example, being incapable of building up any immunity. If that's the case, then why is nothing of this mentioned in the article?\n\n3. The virus mutated enough for your antibodies to stop working. While not unusual for the type of virus the cornavirus is, the cornavirus itself is similar to SARS, thus likely has a system in it preventing mutations. While it can still mutate, the speed is greatly slowed down. Thus while possible it's also not likely.\n\nThere is obviously also the possibility of a false negative/positive, in which case no reinfection occured.", "created_utc": 1582404128.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "figwi7h", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_f7ujbc", "parent_id": "t3_f7ujbc", "score": 45, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_figwi7h", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/f7ujbc/chinese_coronavirus_patient_reinfected_10_days/figwi7h/"}
