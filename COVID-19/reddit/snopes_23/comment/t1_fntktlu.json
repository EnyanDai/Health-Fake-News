That is my main complaint and you haven't addressed that at all.\n\n>He lives in China, so clearly isn't anti-eastern countries\n\nThe latter does not necessarily follow from the former, so, no, not \"clearly.\" Nor is being actively \"anti-eastern\" necessary to treat foreign countries disrespectfully.\n\nMy claim of bias is based on observation (not where someone lives or whether someone has a daughter) - he alleged cover-ups in several different countries in earlier maps, and no such cover-ups have come to light. The bias may stem from general rumors spread by sensationalist (Western) media, not any personal dishonesty or xenophobia, so it's not a matter of personal offense. Belief without evidence is the opposite of science.\n\n>With the deception going on in a lot of countries, yes, I absolutely believe it is not likely that they have 0 cases\n\nThat is a poor standard of evidence: \"there's *deception* o u t  t h e r e, therefore 'ABSOLUTE BELIEF' in deception in this specific country.\" It's possible there're cases, but they haven't been found yet. It's possible that a small remote country was spared. It's also possible there's deception.
