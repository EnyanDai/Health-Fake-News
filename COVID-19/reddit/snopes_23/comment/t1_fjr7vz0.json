This is not so unusual in testing. So someone who is in the early stages of infection may not have sufficient viral load for the test to come back positive. Like I said though, this is pure speculation on my part based on what I know of other medical tests.\n\nRegarding reinfection, humans are pretty good at mounting immune responses and creating immune memory. The reason we get colds or the flu each year is more to do with viral mutability than our immune systems. It is unclear how mutable covid-19 is afaik but if it less variable than either colds or flu then immunity is at least somewhat expected.\n\nIf course there is no certainty in medicine ever. For example it is 'common knowledge' that you develop immunity to chicken pox once you've had it, but anecdotally, I've had it twice so clearly it is not a hard and fast rule so much as being generally true for most people. Chances are that even if you were to get it more than once your second infection would be much less severe.", "created_utc": 1583582468.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fjr7vz0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_femvc3", "parent_id": "t1_fjq55dp", "score": 30, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fjr7vz0", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/femvc3/who_says_theres_no_evidence_of_reinfected/fjr7vz0/"}
