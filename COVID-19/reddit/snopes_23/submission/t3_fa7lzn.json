She first tested positive in late January and was discharged from the hospital after recovering on Feb 1, according to the statement.\n\n> The health ministry confirmed the case was the first in Japan where a patient tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being discharged from hospital, the Nikkei newspaper said.\n\n> Health minister Katsunobu Kato said in Parliament that the central government would need to review patient lists and keep tabs on the condition of those previously discharged, as health experts analysed the implications of testing positive for the virus after an initial recovery.\n\n> Though a first in Japan, cases of second positive tests have been reported in China, where the disease originated late last year.\n\n> A major Japanese bank reported an employee had tested positive for coronavirus.\n\n\n*****\n[**Summary Source**](https://smmry.com/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japanese-woman-reinfected-with-coronavirus-weeks-after-initial-recovery) | [FAQ](http://autotldr.io/ \"437735 summaries so far.\") | [Feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **test**^#1 **positive**^#2 **TOKYO**^#3 **Japan**^#4 **reported**^#5\n\nPost found in [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fa6zun/japanese_woman_reinfected_with_coronavirus_weeks/), [/r/Coronavirus](http://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa7g1i/japanese_woman_reinfected_with_coronavirus_weeks/) and [/r/China_Flu](http://np.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fa7fok/japanese_woman_reinfected_with_coronavirus_weeks/).\n\n*NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.
