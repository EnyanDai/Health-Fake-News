Cats and ferrets in particular are more prone to human respiratory diseases than most other pets. But just because they can be infected doesn't mean they can always spread disease  They're frequently used as lab models for Influenza and now covid. Tigers and lions are both prone to upper respiratory diseases from other species, notably dogs. \n\nSouth Korea did quite a bit of testing of pets and found 1 dog who may or may not have been infected. Another country had a similar case with 1 cat. The US has tested some animals (primates in zoos are at risk etc) but very few. I expect to see a few more outliers like this but it doesn't seem to be a major mode of infection. I could be wrong, but so far it seems rare.\n\n\nEdit - you are right though, often when viruses infect multiple species it has more opportunities to mutate. Think swine and bird flu. It just doesn't seem to be a major factor here thus far and it's had plenty of opportunity.   It has been induced in cats under laboratory conditions but that's not normal life conditions.
