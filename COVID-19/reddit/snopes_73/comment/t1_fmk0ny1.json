SARS-2 back in the early 2000's was transmittable to cats and ferrets but was not as contagious.  No cats died from SARS-2 during lab tests but did show symptoms.  Ferrets were not as lucky and showed mortality rates similar to humans once they caught it, but again it was not as infectious towards them.  SARS COVID-19 shows similarities so I wouldn't worry to much.
