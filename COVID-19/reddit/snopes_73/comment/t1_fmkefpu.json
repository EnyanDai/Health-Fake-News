That's one of the reason's this is so deadly (2-3.5% mortality average in humans).  Bats have probably become immune to this particular virus and while it may affect cats, ferrets and dogs they clearly aren't as affected as humans otherwise we'd see many, many more deaths and sickness in EU pets.  I did find an article about a dog dying from Covid-19.  We should feel lucky ourselves as some years ago in China they recorded a SARS type virus from Bats with a 60% death rate in humans.  Luckily it was extremely hard to transfer and very few people died.  The longer animals have been domesticated and around humans the more universally their virus types are to us.  Cows, Horses, Dogs and Sheep have been domesticated for tens of thousands of years and sickness from them is rare (mad cow disease is one).  Cats less so and ferrets even less so.  Whereas bats and some of the other forest meat animals that China butchers are just now being exposed to humans and thus their viruses are coming in contact with us.  It has everything to do with how humans treat the earth and global warming and how China eats rare animals that humans probably shouldn't be eating.", "created_utc": 1586152220.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkefpu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "parent_id": "t1_fmkb21t", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkefpu", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvkx7k/bronx_zoo_says_one_of_its_tigers_has_tested/fmkefpu/"}
