China\u2019s actually kind of up shit creek right now because of their export-focused economy. They\u2019re giving away medical supplies because they\u2019re well and truly fucked if the global marketplace doesn\u2019t start buying again in a big hurry.\n\nChina is *way* more dependent on strong international exports than the US is, and coronavirus is fucking that over. \n\n> We already boosted the debt with a tax break that wasn't going to be paid for and now have at least 2 (maybe three) new stimulus packages already sent or in the pipeline.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t any evidence the US can\u2019t support that level of debt. Everyone panics over national debt, but governments with a strong tax base (even if they choose not to actually tax it) are extremely debt-tolerant. \n\nCertainly it would be far worse if the US were to respond with fiscal austerity right now. A high national debt-to-GDP ratio is way less dangerous than, say, freezing up the financial system. \n\n> Except when he's in charge during a global crisis and plans his policy around photo-ops for re-election rather than actually handling the crisis.\n\nThe he US has limped along through his presidency because it\u2019s a fairly decentralized system. It remains a fairly decentralized system.\n\nLet me put it another way. Let\u2019s suppose the worst case scenario happens, and 4% of the US population dies to coronavirus. The US still comes out of that as a global superpower. Superpowers don\u2019t stop being superpowers simply due to the mountain of corpses they leave behind\u2014world history is pretty clear on that part. \n\n> And Trump isn't a blithering idiot when it comes to public relations. His numbers with his base are at an all time high, I think.\n\nThere\u2019s always a rally around the flag effect during a national crisis. Trump\u2019s has been the weakest in history. If his rally effect has peaked now, he is fucked in November. His base can be as rabidly supportive as they like\u2014they will still lose if Democratic turnout is even mediocre in November.", "created_utc": 1586172303.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkxggl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvm3sv", "parent_id": "t1_fmk52vo", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8f", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkxggl", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/skeptic/comments/fvm3sv/this_is_very_scary_tiger_at_nycs_bronx_zoo_tests/fmkxggl/"}
