Don't get me wrong, I'd normally agree humans before animalsz but your COVID test isn't getting set to the Veterinary Testing Labs in Chicago, nor would you want them to go there, assuming you are not an animal.\n\nWhen we start sending human samples to animal labs, that's when we have a problem.\n\nYou wouldn't trust a vet to examine you, you don't want to trust the lower standards (and assumingly, very different types) of animal testing to be used for diagnosing you.\n\nLike I said, I'm all about humans first, then animals but in this case, the matter is moot. Think of the vet lab to the human lab as the vet doctor of your dog or cats doctor to your own doctor. They aren't interchangable and you wouldn't want them to be.\n\nIf they sent your test to the vet, you'd say \"OMG, we are sending human tests to vet labs, we think of our nurses as dogs?\"", "created_utc": 1586173293.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmkyggw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvoerq", "parent_id": "t1_fmk9ps5", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3gdh7", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmkyggw", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/comments/fvoerq/tiger_tests_positive_for_coronavirus_at_bronx_zoo/fmkyggw/"}
