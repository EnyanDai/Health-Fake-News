One had a mild respiratory issue last week \u2013 frequent sneezing, but normal energy level and eating/drinking otherwise. One night he seemed to be sneezing more frequently, and I was planning on taking him right in to the vet when they opened, but by the morning he had dramatically improved (he's 5 yo, no medical issues). Been absolutely fine since.\n\nMy younger cat \u2013 who has become mildly overweight after I brought him back to the US as a kitten to live indoors after living semi-feral in my old home in Central America, though his vet has not thought it to be too significant \u2013\u00a0is now having a harder time over the past two days. I've been in close contact with his vet and a 24/7 animal hospital. Lots of sneezing and more lethargic, though eating/drinking normally. It's terrifying me, since I have also been on self-quarantine after exhibiting a consistent fever and body aches. I'm now nearing 72 hours since my last recorded fever/7 days since exhibiting mild symptoms not requiring medical care.\n\nNot only am I worried now I may have passed something on to my cats but that I can't get one the medical attention he may need until later tomorrow without potentially (I have not been tested) putting a vet and animal hospital staff in harm's way.\n\nI hope everything is ok with your cats! Sending positive thoughts your way.\n\nEdit: I don't want to cause any alarm, as I know many of these comments, including my own, are anecdotal \u2013\u00a0and the main study linked in these threads is representative of a very small sample size and focused on transmission.
