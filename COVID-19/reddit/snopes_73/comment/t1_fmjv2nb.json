All three beta coronaviruses emerged via zoonotic transmission. Risk factors for zoonotic transmission of SARS and MERS were direct contact with infected animals. The suspected reservoir hosts are currently believed to be bats, similar to the SARS epidemic.*\n\n\n.\n\nIf tigers and house cats can serve as a resevoir AND transmitter of the virus, it means its virtually impossible to \"wipe out\" the virus without wiping out the reservoir animals.\n\n.\n\nBats in a distant province in China are one thing, but the tabby down the street is another thing etirely with respect to how likely the virus will jump back to humans.\n\nThere are around 96 million domestic cats in teh USA and as many as 600 million world wide.\n\nA 0.01% chance of human-cat interaction transmitting the virus either way is far more likely then the original sequence of events in Wuhan China repeating itself and cat-to-cat transmission has been documented, so if one cat in a city gets it, all are suspect.\n\nAre you going to exterminate all cats in NYC as part of the aftermath of COVID-19?", "created_utc": 1586138345.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmjv2nb", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_fvm3sv", "parent_id": "t1_fmjnrb9", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8f", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586138672.0, "name": "t1_fmjv2nb", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/skeptic/comments/fvm3sv/this_is_very_scary_tiger_at_nycs_bronx_zoo_tests/fmjv2nb/"}
