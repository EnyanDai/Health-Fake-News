Viruses can sometimes infect other species (zoonotic), which are usually essentially \"dead ends\". For example there was a virus which infected humans from camels a while back, but humans didn't shed it in such a way that other humans could catch it (it's not an uncommon phenomenon, that's just the example which jumps to mind). \n\nRemember that the visible symptoms of an illness are the body's defense again the virus, not a product of the virus itself being successful. So an immune system rejecting a pathogen doesn't mean the virus is thriving, reproducing and shedding. In those instances an organism is mildly suceptible, but ultimately is a dead end for the virus.\n\nIt's definitely not out of the question that animals could become infected and become vectors, but right now the number of people who have pets vs the number of pets infected/dying would suggest it's mostly just a curiousity that a few odd cats or dogs get symptoms, and not a huge risk to pets or humans.
