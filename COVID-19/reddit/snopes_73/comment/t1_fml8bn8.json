The results are based on lab experiments in which a small number of animals were deliberately given high doses of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, and do not represent real-life interactions between people and their pets, says virologist Linda Saif at the Ohio State University in Wooster. There is no direct evidence that the infected cats secreted enough coronavirus to pass it on to people, she says. \n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00984-8\n\n\n>Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in cats should be considered as part of efforts to eliminate COVID-19 in humans, the authors note in the preprint\n\n\n___\n\n>Previous studies of SARS-CoV, the related coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), showed that cats can be infected and pass it on to other cats. But \u201cthere was no indication during the SARS pandemic that SARS-CoV became widespread in house cats or was transmitted from cats to humans\u201d, says Saif.", "created_utc": 1586181033.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fml8bn8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "parent_id": "t1_fmj90py", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fml8bn8", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvkx7k/bronx_zoo_says_one_of_its_tigers_has_tested/fml8bn8/"}
