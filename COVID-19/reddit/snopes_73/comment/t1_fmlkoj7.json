The agency expects all of the big cats to recover.\n\nThough it is interesting that the virus *appears* to have jumped from human to animal, please do not panic and assume that it can do the reverse.  There's no evidence of that.\n\nIt is really rare for viruses to jump from animal to human and that does happen; it shouldn't be a big concern right now.\n\nFor now if you want to focus on something, focus on keeping yourself and (sure, why not) your pets away from others until we have a treatment or enough testing that we can more more surgically isolate the hot spots for lock down.\n\n**EDIT**: Regarding: \"*please do not panic and assume that it can do the reverse.  There's no evidence of that.*\"  **I'm referring to lions and tigers and bears and your pets specifically not the entire animal kingdom.**  Yes, there is solid evidence this originally jumped from one species to another then to humans.", "created_utc": 1586188291.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmlkoj7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvo10r", "parent_id": "t3_fvo10r", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_3m5ib", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1586191878.0, "name": "t1_fmlkoj7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/u_timemagazine/comments/fvo10r/a_tiger_at_the_bronx_zoo_has_tested_positive_for/fmlkoj7/"}
