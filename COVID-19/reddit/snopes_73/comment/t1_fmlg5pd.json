I could casually test dozens of people, animals, etc. in one day if I was provided samples. The issue comes with tests that are federally approved and that hospitals are willing to use. The majority of biology labs in the country have access to qPCR machines, which are the only specialized equipment necessary to run a test. The reagents don't need to come from the CDC kits, all someone needs are oligonucleotide primers (which would cost about $20-30 in total to order the same 3 pairs from the CDC kits) and then whatever reagents they normally use for qPCR, which, again, is a very commonly performed assay in research labs.\n\nBut since people in labs largely have no way to safely acquire patient samples, they aren't doing any testing at a meaningful scale. I know several labs have volunteered to take patient samples from hospitals to help out, but many hospitals have declined (citing the need to used the approved tests, fears of liability if samples are mishandled or patients misdiagnosed, etc.).", "created_utc": 1586185755.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmlg5pd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvo4z8", "parent_id": "t1_fmkym9g", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn7", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmlg5pd", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/biology/comments/fvo4z8/a_tiger_at_the_bronx_zoo_tests_positive_for/fmlg5pd/"}
