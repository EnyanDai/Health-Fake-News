They can, by definition, jump between species.  \n\nYeah as likely as it can jump from animal to human it can jump from animal to animal. Zoonotic simply means coming from an animal. It doesn't give the pathogen a special ability.\n\n> Since this is a novel virus, we don\u2019t yet know which species can get it, whether to become ill or to serve as a viral reservoir. \n\nWe haven't had any reports of animals getting COVID before these cases. It's safe to say the disease mutated. We already know it did based on strain genome but that it mutated enough to cause disease in Felidae\n\n> My understanding is that both cats and humans have ACE2 receptors \n\nDifferent protein structures, same action. ACE2 receptors aren't just one brand fits all type of proteins. They are like HLA and they differ between species a lot let alone between humans. The fact that SARS-CoV-2 can not only jump between species but effectively make them ill means it can survive outside of humans. Which was one of the weakest point a pathogen can have. That's the reason we eliminated smallpox. If humans are the only host, we can treat it and eradicate it like SARS-1 but if it is like MERS and can survive outside of human ecosystem then it won't be eradicated.", "created_utc": 1586141391.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fmk04l7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fvkx7k", "parent_id": "t1_fmjz2zg", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fmk04l7", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fvkx7k/bronx_zoo_says_one_of_its_tigers_has_tested/fmk04l7/"}
