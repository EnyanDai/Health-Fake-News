They found that blood type A  patients showed a higher rate of infection and they tended to develop  more severe symptoms. \n\nIn this case it looks like they looked at the % distribution of each group in a sick and healthy population, which should account for a difference in how common certain blood types are. Making up numbers here, if the blood type distribution is normally 30/30/25/15 for types A/B/AB/O respectively, then the ratio should be the same for a sick population if blood type has no effect. If the ratio in a sick population is instead 60/18/14/8 for types A/B/AB/O respectively, then that would suggest type A may be more vulnerable to the illness. Whether that vulnerability is in terms of infection odds or complications odds is another matter.\n\nRegardless, just remember that, as u/DecoySnailProducer said, this study has not yet been reviewed for validity. It could very well be a fluke or a result of some error in the process. Also I have no medical background and a limited statistical background, so take that in consideration in regards to anything I say.
