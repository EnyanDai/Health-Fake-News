The theory is that this is an \"animal\" virus like SARS, MERS and H1N1. Something our human bodies don't get regular exposure to such as influenza.\n\nA significant difference between Type O is its lack of antigens. \n\nThere is an unproven theory our cave dwelling ancestors were all Type O and we evolved into developing antigens as our diet changed.  From this assumption, the sub-theory is Type-Os are better suited to a meat diet. *Source Dr Dalamo, Eat Right for Your Blood Type. \n\nOf note: the theory of evolution of blood types cannot be proven because we can't pull blood type from rocks. \n\nWe really haven't studied blood types enough but here are some Tyoe-O observations:\n- native North Americans likely crossed over before the antigen evolution\n- Type-O can process meat better which means less need to refrigerate or cook\n- Lactose intolerance at adulthood is very typical \n\nConsuming meat that's gone bad and not getting sick doesn't mean our blood has fended off the bacteria. It can mean the bacteria simply passed through without triggering a reaction. Perfect if one can only hunt for food and store it in the back of a cave. \n\nIts the lack of antigens which allows COVID to infect the body without clotting. The antigens don't attach themselves because there are none. \n\nThere are preliminary studies looking into Type-A antigen reacting to the virus. From this theory, Type-AB (double-antigen) would also be prone. \n\nHowever, what would be needed is to qualify that. And as uncommon as Type-O is, Type AB is rarer.", "created_utc": 1591361710.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fsyuz4w", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gwqg4a", "parent_id": "t1_fswtv7o", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fsyuz4w", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwqg4a/people_with_blood_type_a_more_likely_to_suffer/fsyuz4w/"}
