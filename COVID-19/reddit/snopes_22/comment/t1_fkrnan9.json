You're literally too stupid. I'm impressed.\n\nYour inability to keep track of the conversation does not equate to me being too stupid to argue with.\n\n> But, the OP was comparing Italy and South Korea. The criticism that the Italian government has received, versus the praise that the South Korean government has received for their response to the pandemic. If blood type is a factor in transmission of the virus... nevermind, you're too dumb to get it.\n\nHere is the first post you made (https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fk25dk/people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more_vulnerable/fkqhat8/ ) and the reddit post you were replying to is comparing Type A and Type O infection rates and results:  https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3075567/people-blood-type-may-be-more-vulnerable-coronavirus-china-study\n\n> For everyone else:\n> \n> Italy's population has over 25 million ppl with blood type A South Korea has about 17.25 million ppl with blood type A\n\nIrrelevant to your comment of \"Italians are overwhelmingly blood type A.\"\n\n> A difference of 7.75 million people.... Italy has 7.75 million more ppl with blood type A than South Korea does.\n\nIrrelevant to your comment of \"Italians are overwhelmingly blood type A.\"\n\n\n**At this point I sincerely believe you've lost track of what you're posting and replying to.  Maybe take a nap.**\n\n**And beyond that**:  If your point in the original post was that \"Italy has a higher rate of type A blood than South Korea does\" your post of \"Wow, and everyone is blaming Italy for their response (compared with.SK)... Italians are overwhelmingly blood type A.\" is terrible at conveying such a simple idea.\n\nThe ellipse is used to show that something has been removed from a quote.  Since you weren't quoting anything it has no place in your sentance.\n\nEven assuming the incorrect usage of a pause in the thought, pausing at the end of \"Wow, and everyone is blaming Italy for their response (compared with.SK)\" implies strongly that the \"compared with.SK\" in parenthesis, is referring to the \"blaming Italy for their response\" and not \"Italians are overwhelmingly blood type A. (compared with.SK)\"\n\nAnd what's with the \"with.SK\"?  That \".\" should be a space.\n\nReally, your insistence that you wrote something you didn't and your insulting manner just shows you need a nap and your binky.", "created_utc": 1584472204.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkrnan9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fk25dk", "parent_id": "t1_fkrm7da", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": 1584473678.0, "name": "t1_fkrnan9", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fk25dk/people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more_vulnerable/fkrnan9/"}
