There are important limitations to consider in interpreting this study. There was likely unequal exposure to the index patient among the participants; we could not quantify this. The small sample size limits our power to detect less than a 90% increase or decrease in risk. However, investigating exposure to additional patients after the index outbreak would be difficult because of the effects of different SARS-CoV strains and the use of personal protective gear. These results should be considered very preliminary, but suggest that factors related to ABO blood type may be related to susceptibility to SARS. \n\nDid any group follow up?", "created_utc": 1584461102.0, "distinguished": null, "id": "fkr3gwf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fk25dk", "parent_id": "t1_fkqesw2", "score": 28, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x4yx", "downs": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "edited": false, "name": "t1_fkr3gwf", "collapsed": false, "permalink": "/r/Coronavirus/comments/fk25dk/people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more_vulnerable/fkr3gwf/"}
