(I'm a bot)\n*****\n> In contrast, &quot;Blood group O had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease compared with non-O blood groups&quot;, according to a paper they published on Medrxiv.org on March 11.Of 206 patients who had died from Covid-19 in Wuhan, 85 had type A blood, which was 63 per cent more than the 52 with type O. The pattern existed across different age and gender groups.\n\n> Another limitation of the study was that it did not provide a clear explanation about the phenomenon, such as the molecular interaction between the virus and different types of red blood cells, Gao said.\n\n> Blood types are determined by a so-called antigen, a material on the surface of red blood cells that can trigger an immune response.\n\n> Austrian biologist Karl Landsteiner discovered the main blood groups in 1901, naming them type A, B, AB and O. The discovery allowed for safe blood transfusions by matching blood types in patients.\n\n> In the United States, about 44 per cent of the population is type O, while about 41 per cent is type A. In Wuhan, which has a population of about 11 million, type O is 32 per cent, while A is 34 per cent among healthy people.\n\n> Blood type difference has been observed in other infectious diseases including Norwalk virus, hepatitis B and severe acute respiratory syndrome, according to previous studies.\n\n\n*****\n[**Summary Source**](https://smmry.com/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3075567/people-blood-type-may-be-more-vulnerable-coronavirus-china-study) | [FAQ](http://autotldr.io/ \"442812 summaries so far.\") | [Feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **blood**^#1 **type**^#2 **cent**^#3 **per**^#4 **patients**^#5\n\nPost found in [/r/Coronavirus](http://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fk25dk/people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more_vulnerable/), [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fk249r/people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more_vulnerable/), [/r/Coronavirus](http://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fk25dk/people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more_vulnerable/), [/r/Coronavirus_BC](http://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus_BC/comments/fk2ktq/people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more_vulnerable/), [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fk2jed/people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more_vulnerable/) and [/r/SCMPauto](http://np.reddit.com/r/SCMPauto/comments/fk25fq/world_people_with_blood_type_a_may_be_more/).\n\n*NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.
