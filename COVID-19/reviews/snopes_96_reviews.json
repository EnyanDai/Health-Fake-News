It\u2019s a composite of at least two images, and the location it supposedly shows does not even exist.\u00a0\nRoads near Dubai (and other desert locales) truly can get covered in sand after storms, which can lead to some spectacular images. Photographer Irenaeus Herok, for instance, has captured several aerial pictures of real sand-covered highways near Dubai, such as this one from 2016:\n\nA post shared by Irenaeus Herok (@iherok) on Dec 4, 2016 at 9:54am PST\n\nThe YouTube page \u201cDrone Collective\u201d has also posted several videos of such sand-covered roads in Dubai:\nHowever, the scene depicted in the viral photograph \u2014 a two-lane highway stretching unimpeded into the distance as the skyline of Dubai rests on the horizon \u2014 does not exist.\nFor starters, no such lengthy stretch of desert highway leading in and out of Dubai lines up perfectly with the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, as shown in the viral image. Secondly, while we have encountered a number of similar images supposedly showing a sand-covered highway leading to Dubai, these images were digital composites. In other words, they were created by taking at least two distinct images and then editing them together.\nThe trick apparently is to take a drone photograph of a long stretch of partially sand-covered desert highway and then to photoshop the skyline of Dubai into the background. A number of travel photographers have made their own versions of this scene, including Husain Ujjainwala, a photographer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who posted a \u201cbefore and after\u201d version of his edit.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how this stretch of highway looked in Ujjainwala\u2019s original photograph (left) and after it was edited (right) to include the Dubai skyline:\n\nUjjainwala captured these images: \u201cInstagram Vs Reality. Not everything you see on Instagram is real.\u201d\nThese fake Dubai skyline images often circulate on social media as if they are genuine photographs. This has inspired a few adventurous photographers, such as Ty Poland, a writer for the photography website FStoppers, to set out for Dubai in order to capture this tremendous view. Unfortunately, this scene can only be captured via photo-editing software.\u00a0\nPoland wrote an article entitled \u201cDiscovering Fake Dubai: A Road That Led to Nowhere\u201d on FStoppers in 2018 after an amazing, yet somewhat disappointing, visit to Dubai:\n\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve seen photos like this so many times on my Instagram over the past three years or so. I said to myself that if I ever get to go to Dubai, I want to do my own version of this photo. When I got out there, I tried to do just that. After spending some time on Google maps looking for where this road could be, Martin and I decided to take it or leave it and head to the location we thought this one spot could be.\nAs we rolled up, we noticed the road was blocked off and the area seemed to be restricted. There was not a shot we would be able to get to that spot. We went back to check Google for more spots with this potential view, but soon discovered that we had been fooled by other photos of \u201cfake\u201d Dubai.\nEvery time I saw these pictures, I thought they were real. I\u2019d always wonder how these people got onto these roads covered by this sand with such a beautiful iconic view. For me, it kind of hurt to find out it we\u2019d been fooled, but it allowed me to create a scene of my own and actually plan to do it.\nPoland posted his version of this scene on Instagram along with the caption \u201cFinding places that don\u2019t exist\u201d and the hashtag #photoshop:\n\nA post shared by Ty Poland (@typoland) on Oct 10, 2018 at 3:49pm PDT\n\nAs we investigated this photograph, we kept coming across comments that asked what city officials in Dubai did to clear the roads of sand after a storm. Did they have sand plows? An army of shovel-wielding sand clearers? The answer to both of those questions, generally speaking, is yes. In 2012, shortly after a sandstorm left many of Dubai\u2019s roads covered in sand, The National in UAE reported that Dubai used road-sweeping machines and manual labor in order to clear the roads:\nMunicipal workers were kept busy all weekend shoveling tones of sand from choked highways and arterial roads.\n\u201cWe had to work like an emergency team to remove the sand in time,\u201d said Yaqoob Al Ali, the head of Dubai Municipality\u2019s cleaning section. \u201cIt was a big challenge to get the highways clear.\n\u201cWe cannot leave sand on the highways or accidents will happen. It is a danger zone. During a sandstorm people cannot control the car. It skids and slips because drivers cannot tell how deep the sand is.\u201d", "links": ["https://twitter.com/AventuraObscura/status/1261954844887310337", "https://www.thenational.ae/uae/sandstorm-clear-up-begins-1.405933", "https://www.iherok.com/", "https://www.boredpanda.com/desert-aerial-drone-photography-irenaeus-herok-dubai", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BNmrUWoAodZ/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading", "https://fstoppers.com/aerial/discovering-fake-dubai-road-led-nowhere-306165", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BoxRsApHQtS/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/05/before-and-after.jpg"]}
