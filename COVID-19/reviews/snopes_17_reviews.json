{"title": "No, a Hair Dryer Won\u2019t Stop Coronavirus", "subtitle": "A viral video that claims breathing hot air from a hair dryer could cure COVID-19 demonstrates a basic and dangerous lack of understanding about science.", "date": "17 March 2020", "claim": "Using a hair dryer to breathe in hot air can cure COVID-19 and stop its spread.", "rating": "False", "true_part": "", "false_part": "", "content": "Viral misinformation about the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic was rampant in mid-March 2020. One example was a video created by \u201cfuturologist\u201d D\u00e4n Lee Dimke who claimed that sticking a blow dryer in your face or sitting in a sauna and breathing in hot air would kill the coronavirus.\nThe information given by Dimke in the video is not just false, but potentially dangerous.\nIf you believe you\u2019re infected with the virus, you should isolate yourself from other people and contact a medical professional.\nWe asked Google, which owns YouTube, what measures are being taken to prevent the spread of misinformation during the ongoing pandemic. We received no response in time for publication, but the link to the video we sent was removed.\nThat said, copies of the video, or videos that repeat the false claim, remain live on the platform as of this writing. Many of the videos contain the logo of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), potentially giving the false impression that the information was sourced from the government agency on the front lines of battling the disease.\n\nNo reputable medical professionals or institutions recommend people breathe hot air to kill the coronavirus. Contrary to what the video states, viruses don\u2019t make you sick by congregating in your nasal cavities. They make you sick on a cellular level via mechanisms not easily stopped by something as simple as hot air.\nBecause COVID-19 is caused by a new type of coronavirus, its danger is exacerbated by the fact that no therapeutic treatment has yet been developed, and no vaccine is yet available to prevent it. The CDC recommends that to protect yourself from infection, you should wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing.\nAlthough Dimke describes himself as \u201cDr. Dan Lee Dimpke\u201d in the viral video, Dimke is not a medical doctor. In a biography on his website, he claims to have a doctoral degree in education from Southwest University and a master\u2019s degree in business administration. His biography lists a number of unusual skills (jet helicopter pilot, for one) but doesn\u2019t describe any educational or professional experience that would qualify him to provide medical advice.\nSharing misinformation during a pandemic could potentially have lethal consequences. COVID-19 is deadlier than the seasonal flu and in a matter of three months has spread globally. As residents of major U.S. cities were instructed to practice social distancing or in some situations shelter in place to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, COVID-19 has sickened and killed thousands worldwide.", "links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPbRo3YnTo8&t=7s", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html", "https://archive.is/F1OCF", "https://medlineplus.gov/viralinfections.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html", "https://archive.is/78Zr0#selection-165.306-165.413", "https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0320_article", "https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200317-sitrep-57-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=a26922f2_2"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/03/dimke.jpg"]}
