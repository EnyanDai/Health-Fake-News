The \u201cSacrifice the Weak\u201d sign is real, although we can\u2019t say for certain whether this protester was holding this sign in earnest, or displaying it ironically as a way to mock these protests.\u00a0\nThis screenshot comes from a WKRN broadcast featuring reporter Elizabeth Lane. Here\u2019s the full video of Lane\u2019s report. The \u201cSacrifice the Weak\u201d sign can be seen around the 1:40 mark:\nOur coverage of an anti-shutdown rally in Tennessee is getting a lot of attention.

Lane said that some people had asked if the protest sign was \u201csatire\u201d but said she did not have an answer:\nThis is the protestor drawing the most attention. I\u2019m getting lots of questions \u2014 we did not speak with her & did not see her sign until this screenshot was taken. Many people have emailed asking if this was satire, perhaps. To those questions, I do not have answers. pic.twitter.com/GkPKboTVQQ\n\u2014 Elizabeth Lane WKRN (@elizabethlanetv) April 22, 2020\n\nThis \u201cSacrifice the Weak\u201d sign can also be seen in a broadcast from ABC News Channel 9.\u00a0\nTENNESSEE IN PROTEST: Even with the announcement to start re-opening the state's economy on May 1, Governor Bill Lee has been facing some sharp criticism for not starting the process immediately. https://t.co/Pn3jY7k85S\n\u2014 WTVC NewsChannel 9 (@newschannelnine) April 21, 2020\n", "links": ["https://twitter.com/ConorBlenner/status/1252870171422715907", "https://t.co/50lnAahuPL", "https://twitter.com/elizabethlanetv/status/1253018667165593600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/GkPKboTVQQ", "https://twitter.com/elizabethlanetv/status/1253018959491858432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://newschannel9.com/news/coronavirus/scammers-play-on-users-fears-as-coronavirus-spreads", "https://t.co/Pn3jY7k85S", "https://twitter.com/newschannelnine/status/1252414298594238467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/04/sacrifice-the-weak.png"]}
