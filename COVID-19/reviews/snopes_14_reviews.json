One frequently copied and pasted bit of text that has gone viral on Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp purports to impart \u201cserious excellent advice\u201d from \u201cJapanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.\u201d\nThat \u201cadvice\u201d asserts regular sips of water can prevent the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, from entering the respiratory system:\nSERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.\u00a0 Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY?\u00a0 Even if the virus gets into your mouth \u2026 drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in tummy \u2026 your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don\u2019t drink enough water more regularly \u2026 the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That\u2019s very dangerous.\nThe \u201cserious excellent advice by Japanese doctors\u201d text is often combined with other viral coronavirus claims including a paragraph about a \u201cself-check\u201d attributed to \u201cTaiwan experts,\u201d and a set of recommendations that begins with a claim about differentiating between a cold and COVID-19. Snopes addressed the \u201cTaiwan experts self-check\u201d claim here\u00a0and addressed the list of tips that begins with a dubious method of distinguishing a cold from COVID-19 here. This article deals only with the claim regarding sipping water every 15 minutes.\nIt is true that COVID-19 infects the respiratory system by directly entering the body through the mouth or nose. This fact is central to both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to wash hands frequently and avoid touching your face. The assertion in this viral \u201cadvice,\u201d however, is that if the virus were already in your mouth, water would help wash it away. Though medical officials recommend drinking water during any infection, no evidence exists to support the notion that sipping water prevents a virus from infecting the respiratory system.\nDrinking more water, while good for your overall health, will not keep anyone from catching the coronavirus, according to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. Schaffner told The Associated Press, \u201cWe always caution anyone healthy and people who are sick to keep up fluid intake and keep mucus membranes moist.\u201d He also said: \u201cIt makes you feel better; there is no clear indication that it directly protects you against complications.\u201d\nDr. Susan Wootton, an infectious disease expert at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, agreed with that assessment, telling KHOU that no data exist to support the claim that sipping water will prevent infection by transporting it to the stomach.\nBecause no evidence supports the claim, we rank the notion that sipping water regularly prevents COVID-19 infection as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "links": ["http://archive.vn/IioqF", "http://archive.vn/wip/C5OcJ", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/taiwan-experts-self-check/", "https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/03/05/uncle-coronavirus/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html", "https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public", "https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8551030197", "https://www.khou.com/article/news/verify/verify-does-drinking-water-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19/285-a661bc55-c0a8-41ce-9cb4-33df65253a3c"], "imgs": []}
