And in mid-March 2020, social media users claimed that during one of these public sessions Trump said, \u201cPeople are dying that have never died before.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThis does not appear to reference a real quote uttered by Trump, but instead a long-standing internet joke.\nNoticeably, none of the social media posts claiming Trump made this statement included a video clip or other proof he said it, and that\u2019s because there was none to show. We found no evidence that Trump said this during any recent public announcements about the coronavirus disease.\nHowever, we did find that this quote has appeared on Twitter as far back as 2008:\n\nWe found no documentation proving Trump made this comment. (Nor any evidence that former Alabama Gov. George Wallace said it either.) We therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "links": ["https://twitter.com/search?q=People%20Are%20Dying%20That%20Have%20Never%20Died%20Before&src=typed_query"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/03/trump.png", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/03/trump.jpg"]}
