Details about the alleged execution are scarce, and we have yet to see any substantiated reports about the person\u2019s purported death.\u00a0\nThe claim that Kim ordered the country\u2019s first coronavirus patient to be executed is likely related to a report from the South Korean newspaper Donga. On Feb. 13, Donga reported, citing sources from North Korea, that a bureaucrat who had been quarantined as a precautionary measure was executed after breaking quarantine to visit a public bath. Donga reports that this person was allegedly sentenced to death because the public\u2019s health was put at risk.\nThis report comes from anonymous sources and does not provide specific details about the incident (such as the name of the public facility or the name of the official). While other outlets have picked up on this report, they all appear to be based on the same anonymous sources and lack any specific verifiable details.\u00a0\nVerifying rumors from North Korea is difficult because the country has strict control over its media. As of this writing, North Korea maintains it has not had a single case of COVID-19 within its borders.\u00a0\nThe Associated Press reported on March 13:\nThe top American general in South Korea said Friday he is fairly certain North Korea has not been spared by the\u00a0COVID-19 outbreak\u00a0that began in neighboring China, although the North has not publicly confirmed a single case.\nSpeaking by video-teleconference from his headquarters in South Korea, Army Gen. Robert Abrams told reporters at the Pentagon that the North had halted military training for a month \u2014 including a 24-day hiatus in military flying \u2014 but has since resumed.\n\u201cIt is a closed-off nation, so we can\u2019t say emphatically that they have cases, but we\u2019re fairly certain they do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I do know is that their armed forces had been fundamentally in a lockdown for about 30 days and only recently have they started routine training again. As one example, they didn\u2019t fly an airplane for 24 days.\u201d He said they have resumed flying.\nBecause we cannot confirm the accuracy of reports that claim Kim ordered North Korea\u2019s first COVID-19 patient to be executed, we\u2019ve marked this claim as \u201cUnproven.\u201d\u00a0", "links": ["https://twitter.com/Secret_Beijing/status/1232336176175960064", "http://www.donga.com/news/article/all/20200213/99665772/1", "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/alarm-scepticism-korea-claim-coronavirus-free-200319051628072.html", "https://apnews.com/80cee127687b12c7283bfecde9745089"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/03/kim-jong-un.png"]}
