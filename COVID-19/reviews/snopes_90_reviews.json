Against that backdrop, social media users shared posts critical of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the leaders of the administration\u2019s ongoing COVID-19 response. The posts accused Fauci of throwing U.S. President Donald Trump under the bus for a belated response to the growing public health crisis, while failing himself to adequately warn the American public of the looming disease threat.\nSocial media posts by Trump\u2019s supporters highlighted an April 12, 2020, interview on CNN in which host Jake Tapper asked Fauci, \u201cDo you think lives could have been saved if social distancing, physical distancing, stay-at-home measures had started third week of February, instead of mid-March?\u201d\nTo that question, Fauci gave the answer that earned him the ire of Trump\u2019s supporters:\nYou know, Jake, again, it\u2019s the what would have, what could have. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to go back and say that. I mean, obviously, you could logically say, that if you had a process that was ongoing, and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives. Obviously, no one is going to deny that.\nBut what goes into those kinds of decisions is \u2014 is complicated. But you\u2019re right. I mean, obviously, if we had, right from the very beginning, shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.\nIn rebuttal to this perceived criticism of the Trump administration, social media users accused Fauci of himself minimizing the threat in a Feb. 29 television interview.\nOne such tweet, bearing the hashtag #FireFauci was retweeted by Trump on April 12, 2020, raising speculation that the president was preparing to fire the doctor.\n\nAnother tweet complained that Fauci had said it was \u201csafe\u201d to do things like go to the movies and the gym in early February and March but \u201cdropped Trump in the grease on CNN,\u201d or let the president take the blame.\nThese criticisms ignore the context of Fauci\u2019s Feb. 29 commentary and the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 situation.\nOn Feb. 29, Fauci gave an interview on the NBC morning talk show \u201cToday,\u201d during which he stated that at that moment in time, \u201cthe risk is still low, but this could change.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve said that many times even on this program,\u201d Fauci stated in that interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don\u2019t need to change anything you\u2019re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\u201d\nThe situation with COVID-19 in the United States was indeed drastically different on Feb. 29 than it was in mid-April.\nOn Feb. 29, news reports indicated there were 70 known cases in the U.S., and officials were reporting the first known death from the novel coronavirus on American soil. That day also saw the first few reports of \u201ccommunity spread,\u201d or transmission of the disease from an unknown source.\nFauci did say on Feb. 29 that Americans did not need to change their routines for the time being, but he also noted that depending on how the COVID-19 outbreak played out, that could all change, and in the coming weeks, it did.\nSince that day, COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic, more than half a million cases have been reported in the United States, and the death toll has rapidly climbed past 20,000 with most of the American public under guidance to stay home in order to slow the spread of the virus.\nFauci later clarified that in the April 12 interview, he was responding to a \u201chypothetical\u201d question about the administration\u2019s response but noted that his wording choice was \u201cpoor\u201d and that administration officials had in fact heeded his early recommendations about social distancing guidelines.\nFauci also noted that his comments in a CNN interview were interpreted by some to mean that the Trump administration gave medical experts \u201cpush back\u201d that cost lives at the beginning of the outbreak. He acknowledged that his answer was not worded well and largely misconstrued. We therefore rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d", "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html", "http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2004/12/sotu.01.html", "https://archive.is/4IGWn", "https://archive.is/H1Gm8", "https://www.today.com/video/dr-fauci-on-coronavirus-fears-no-need-to-change-lifestyle-yet-79684677616", "https://abcnews.go.com/US/high-school-student-washington-latest-coronavirus-community-spread/story?id=69301655", "https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0229-COVID-19-first-death.html", "https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/11/814474930/coronavirus-covid-19-is-now-officially-a-pandemic-who-says", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/04/tweet-1.jpg"]}
