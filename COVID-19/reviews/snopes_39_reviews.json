It will be the end of the world economy as you know it.\n\nMichel de Nostradame was an astrologer who lived in France in the 1500s and is most famous today for the poetic quatrains he wrote for his book, \u201cLes Proph\u00e9ties,\u201d which many enthusiasts now claim foretold various significant historical events. Nostradamus wrote a lot of stuff so general (and obscure) that with the help of a little imagination (and some liberal interpretations from the original French), people have claimed he has \u201cpredicted\u201d nearly every event of significance since the mid-16th century.\nBut this particular viral prediction was not expressed in quatrain form, nor could we find anything like it published in \u201cLes Proph\u00e9ties.\u201d We also found no mention of this supposed prophecy prior to the events of early 2020, which generally indicates it is a modern hoax.", "links": ["https://zelalemkibret.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/the-complete-works-of-nostradamus.pdf", "http://www.nostradamus.org/qbrowser.html"], "imgs": []}
