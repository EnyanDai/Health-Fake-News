During his roughly one-hour, 20-minute commentary, Trump hit back at his political opponents in the Democratic Party for their critiques of his administration\u2019s handling of a potential pandemic.\nHere are Trump\u2019s exact words on the topic at the South Carolina rally:\nNow the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019 They go, \u2018Oh, not good, not good.\u2019 They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa, they can\u2019t even count. No they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t count their votes.\nOne of my people came up to me and said, \u2018Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they\u2019ve been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning, they lost, it\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We\u2019re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\nIn context, Trump did not say in the passage above that the virus itself was a hoax. He instead said that Democrats\u2019 criticism of his administration\u2019s response to it was a hoax. He muddied the waters a few minutes later, however, by comparing the number of coronavirus fatalities in the U.S. (none, at that point in time) to the number of fatalities during an average flu season, and accusing the press of being in \u201chysteria mode\u201d:\nSo a number that nobody heard of that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? 35,000. That\u2019s a lot of people. It could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000, they say usually a minimum of 27, it goes up to 100,000 people a year who die, and so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t, and we are totally prepared, it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t. But think of it. You hear 35 and 40,000 people, and we\u2019ve lost nobody, and you wonder, the press is in hysteria mode.\nFor his part, Trump later defended his comments by stating he was indeed calling out the Democrats\u2019 efforts to blame him and his administration for what they have characterized as an inadequate response \u201cbecause we\u2019ve done such a good job.\u201d\nTrump did however downplay the scale of the virus and the danger it posed to the public. At the time he made his remarks, the U.S. had 57 confirmed coronavirus cases, 40 of which came from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which experienced an outbreak of the virus. And health officials were warning that the spread of the virus domestically was \u201cinevitable.\u201d\nThe novel coronavirus infection has been a fast-moving crisis. Just hours after Trump\u2019s rally in South Carolina, the U.S. had its first coronavirus death. As of this writing (at the beginning of March 2020), six people in the U.S. have died from the COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. Globally, more than 80,000 cases have been identified and 3,000 people have died, while experts have warned the outbreak of the virus could become a pandemic.\nAlthough Trump made a reference to seasonal flu death rates, COVID-19, which was first detected in the winter of 2019 in Wuhan, China, appears so far to be more lethal. And because the virus is new, no vaccine or treatment exists for it.", "links": ["https://twitter.com/Milbank/status/1233555987149312000", "https://www.ajc.com/news/national-govt--politics/biden-wins-south-carolina-primary-launching-pad-for-his-campaign/DeEny8XNNbGXkqDCpVXAsK/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbwCjL7HC1c", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/joe-biden-trump-coronavirus-hoax-claim", "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/white-house-seeks-2-5b-coronavirus-pelosi-says-s-not-n1142276", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-live-updates/2020/02/25/f4045570-5758-11ea-9000-f3cffee23036_story.html", "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/1st-coronavirus-death-u-s-officials-say-n1145931", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/02/coronavirus-live-updates/", "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-become-pandemic-and-why-it-matters/", "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html#virulence", "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html#vaccine"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/03/milbank-tweet.png"]}
