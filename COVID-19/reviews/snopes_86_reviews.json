Instead, CARES provisions temporarily enable wealthy Americans to report tax losses that they previously could not.", "content": "Responding to an unprecedented disruption to the U.S. economy caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, U.S. President Donald Trump on March 27, 2020, approved a $2.2 trillion stimulus package called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\u00a0\nAiming to provide direct payments to Americans, the relief package authorized the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to send $1,200 checks to low- and middle-class workers. The legislation also boosted funding for unemployment benefits, set aside billions of dollars for loans to help small businesses, and increased health care spending by $100 billion, among other provisions.\nBut the bill included an additional benefit for wealthy Americans, per national media headlines in mid-April: \u201cOver 43,000 U.S. Millionaires will get \u2018stimulus\u2019 averaging $1.6 million each\u201d (New York Post) and \u201cHow Some Rich Americans Are Getting \u2018Checks\u2019 Averaging $1.7 million\u201d (Forbes). Snopes received numerous reader inquiries about the veracity of those reports.\u00a0\nThe claim is multi-pronged: that millionaires and other Americans received the same type of stimulus checks, termed \u201cEconomic Impact Payments\u201d; that those payments were higher for millionaires than for other workers; and that the economic benefits for the country\u2019s wealthiest residents averaged $1.7 million each under the CARES Act.\nThe coronavirus relief package authorized the federal government to send:\nFor single tax filers with higher annual salaries \u2014 but less than $99,000 \u2014 the federal government is reducing the stimulus checks by $5 for each $100 above the $75,000 threshold (similar math goes for payments to families).\nYet here is evidence that proves part of the above claim false, in the words of the IRS: \u201cTax filers with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 for individuals and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns will receive the full payment\u201d \u2014 which does not exceed the amounts of $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for joint claims, and $500 per qualifying child. That means only in this hypothetical situation \u2014 a family had 3,400 qualifying children \u2014 could an American receive a stimulus check of $1.7 million. Here\u2019s language verbatim from the CARES Act:\n\nHowever, the latter part of the claim \u2014 that millionaires could reap an average of $1.7 million in financial gains under the CARES Act \u2014 is less definite.\nThe answer begins with understanding pre-CARES Act tax code. In 2017, the federal government established new limitations on how much money owners of so-called \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses can deduct as losses against their \u201cnonbusiness\u201d income to minimize their tax liability. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, owners of such businesses \u2014 entities where profits flow through to owners and are not subject to corporate income taxes \u2014 could deduct a maximum of $250,000 in losses individually ($500,000 for couples) to offset taxable income from other sources, such as capital gains. Two Democratic Congressmen \u2014 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Llloyd Doggett of Texas \u2014 have explained the rule like this:\nIf one spouse owns a company that had a $5 million loss in 2018 and the other spouse made $5 million from stock market investments, this limitation meant that the couple\u2019s taxable income was $4.5 million (not zero, if the loss were allowed to fully cancel out the income). The other $4.5 million in losses, however, could be carried forward to use in future years.\nProvisions in the CARES Act temporarily suspended that limitation until the start of 2021, according to an analysis of legislative records by Snopes. In other words, the IRS is legally obligated to count excess losses from businesses that it otherwise wouldn\u2019t have and provide them with \u201cthe same treatment as if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had not been enacted,\u201d according to attorneys with the international law firm Foley and Lardner.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the provisions change the timeline of the 2017 law and allow for the new standard to retroactively apply, enabling businesses to report losses in 2018 and 2019 against the past five years. Those taxpayers, however, would likely need to amend their 2018 and 2019 tax returns if they have already been filed to see any changes, according to the tax consulting firm Calvetti Ferguson. \nAnd since the modification under the CARES Act only applies until Dec. 31, 2020, the 2017 law will kick in the following year.\nHere\u2019s how that change to tax code is relevant to the claim: Americans who earn $1 million or more will benefit the most from the temporary suspension on the deduction limit, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan congressional body the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). In early April 2020, Whitehouse and Doggett requested the committee to research \u201cthe distributional effects\u201d of the provision within the CARES Act. Later, the commission\u2019s chief of staff, Thomas Barthold, shared its findings in a letter to the congressmen, including the caveat:\nThere is, of course, a great deal of uncertainty about the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how those economic effects will translate into business losses for individuals. The revenue estimate represents our best effort to give Congress useful information about the potential scale of revenue changes associated with this provision.\nThe letter included the following table, showing what class of Americans will receive what percentage of benefits from the amendment to the 2017 tax law:\n\nThe table shows almost 82% of the provision\u2019s benefits will go toward about 43,000 Americans who earn $1 million or more annually. Put another way, hedge-fund investors and owners of real estate businesses are \u201cfar and away\u201d the two prime beneficiaries of the change to the 2017 tax law, Steve Rosenthal, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told The Washington Post. The JCT also found that suspending the limitation for \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses will cost taxpayers about $90 billion in 2020 alone, the Post reported.\nUsing those numbers, you can do back-of-the-napkin math to estimate the amount of money the country\u2019s wealthiest population could reduce from their tax burden as a result of the change (82% of $90 billion): about $73.8 billion. Then, if you divide that total by the estimated number of impacted Americans who earn $1 million or more (43,000), you end up with an average of $1,716,279 \u2014 or about $1.7 million \u2014 each.\n\u201cIf you take the report\u2019s calculations at face value, that means that, on average, each of the eligible taxpayers would get a windfall of ~$1.7 million!\u201d Forbes contributor Shahar Ziv wrote. \u201cClearly not all of those earning \u2018only\u2019 $1 million will receive a $1.7 million tax cut; however, just as some may receive less than the $1.7 million, some may benefit much more.\u201d\nIn sum, given that U.S. millionaires won\u2019t receive stimulus payments based on their income under the CARES Act but rather the Act\u2019s provisions enable those Americans to take advantage of a temporary tax relief \u2014 potentially to the tune of $1.7 million on average \u2014 we rate this claim as a \u201cMixture\u201d of true and false information.", "links": ["https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-signing-h-r-748-cares-act/", "https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text?fbclid=IwAR02m0Wa0g0InSzH5o1LkqrmEyCR1l2ljF-j293rulP1p7NaKcdtaYXfHRg#toc-H25CA409D9D2844399CF965A38F83F6C6", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/covid-stimulus-check/", "https://nypost.com/2020/04/16/43k-us-millionaires-will-get-stimulus-averaging-1-6m-each/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2020/04/14/why-are-rich-americans-getting-17-million-stimulus-checks/#13702e11665b", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/covid-stimulus-check/", "https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-pass-through-businesses", "https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1enr.pdf", "https://doggett.house.gov/sites/doggett.house.gov/files/NOL%20Ltr.pdf", "https://www.foley.com/en/insights/publications/2020/03/cares-act-summary-of-tax-provision", "https://calvettiferguson.com/coronavirus-income-tax-implications/", "https://www.jct.gov/about-us/role-of-jct.html", "https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/116-0849.pdf", "https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/about", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/14/coronavirus-law-congress-tax-change/"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-21-at-9.18.17-AM.png", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-4.48.42-PM.png"]}
