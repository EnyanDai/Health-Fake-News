They criticized the government officials who made the decision as well as the residents and visitors who went to the beach.\nOthers spoke out in support of the beach reopenings, some of them saying Floridians need fresh air and exercise, and others stating that grocery store shoppers are closer to each other than the beachgoers have been so far.\nThe news reporting on that controversy caused a controversy of its own, however. Some social media users asserted that photographs showing crowds of beach-goers in Jacksonville that were used to illustrate news articles were simply stock photos or unrelated pictures that did not reflect the reality of the situation:\n\n\nAlthough it\u2019s possible a photograph of Jacksonville beaches from the weekend of April 17-19, 2020, might have been inappropriately used somewhere to illustrate a story about a different part of the U.S. (such as California), the pictures seen here are correctly represented as to time and place (i.e., taken in Jacksonville in mid-April 2020). Here are those photographs and their accompanying captions, as stored in the database of the Getty Images visual media company:\n\u00a0\nIt is true, though, that as demonstrated in the following Facebook post, factors such as camera positioning, angle, and lens type can substantially affect the viewer\u2019s perception of how far apart pictured objects are, so a beach that looks crowded in one photo may appear sparsely populated in another:\n", "links": ["https://www.orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/os-ne-coronavirus-floridamorons-hashtag-trends-as-people-visit-beach-20200418-v5damnanrfbdjjho7kwg647wue-story.html", "https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/04/20/slideshow-uproar-reaction-over-social-distancing-at-beaches-is-all-about-perspective/"], "imgs": []}
