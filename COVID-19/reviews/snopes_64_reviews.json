The Belgium-based group said: \u201cThe impact of the Covid-19 virus outbreak on our business continues to evolve.\n\u201cThe outbreak has led to a significant decline in demand in China in both on-premise and in-home channels. Additionally, demand during the Chinese New Year was lower than in previous years as it coincided with the beginning of this outbreak.\u201d\nBut the trope that \u201cpeople are so dumb they\u2019re shunning Corona beer because they think it\u2019s connected to the coronavirus\u201d was too tempting for many news outlets to eschew, even though little or no evidence backed it up. Many of them based their articles on a survey that supposedly documented that \u201c38% of Beer-Drinking Americans Wouldn\u2019t Buy Corona Now,\u201d again suggesting people were being scared off the brand due to mistaken associations between the name of the brand and a virus.\nHowever, that poll was conducted and published by the 5W public relations firm, and it did not find what many news reports gleefully claimed it did. The PR piece stated that a phone survey of 737 American beer drinkers had determined that \u201c38% of Americans would not buy Corona under any circumstances now,\u201d and by offering that statistic in conjunction with other information about the coronavirus, the piece again misleadingly suggested that consumers were being frightened away from Corona beer merely because of its name. But it didn\u2019t provide readers with the questions that the poll\u2019s subjects were asked, nor did it offer any context explaining why respondents answered the way they did. Or, as The Atlantic noted of the issue:\nBy presenting this finding in the context of other questions that are explicitly about the coronavirus, the press release creates the impression that Americans\u2019 reluctance to drink the beer is due to the coronavirus. \u201cThere is no question that Corona beer is suffering because of the coronavirus,\u201d Ronn Torossian, the CEO of 5WPR, says in the press release. \u201cCould one imagine walking into a bar and saying \u2018Hey, can I have a Corona?\u2019 or \u2018Pass me a Corona.\u2019\u201d\nBut this connection is manufactured, and Torossian is ignoring far more mundane reasons Americans might not buy a Corona, including that they don\u2019t like the taste. Of those Americans who did report regularly drinking Corona, only 4 percent said they would now stop drinking the beer.\nA number of major news outlets appear to have walked right into the trap. Because they did not understand that the original press release was walking a fine line between deeply misleading claims and outright lies, their articles have inadvertently fallen on the side of the lie. As a viral tweet by CNN put it, the survey supposedly found that 38 percent of Americans would not drink Corona, \u201cbecause of the coronavirus.\u201d\nHuffington Post did obtain a list of the questions that were put to the poll\u2019s respondents and observed how the results could be used to create misleading impressions:\nHere are the questions that were asked, according to The Dispatch\u2019s Declan Garvey, combined with the results 5WPR chose to include in its press release:\nAre you a beer drinker?\nAre you a Corona drinker?\nIs Corona related to the coronavirus? (16% of beer-drinkers were \u201cconfused\u201d about this.)\nIn light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona? (4% who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d said they planned to stop.)\nWould you buy Corona in a store?\nWould you order a Corona in a restaurant/bar/public venue? (14% who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d said they would not.)\nWould you buy Corona under any circumstances now? (38% of \u201cbeer-drinking Americans\u201d said they would not.)\nThere are any number of ways a careful market researcher might attempt to tease out how, if at all, coronavirus has affected perceptions of the beer. This isn\u2019t one of them. Instead, these questions manage to fail simultaneously in two different directions. On one hand, some of the phrasing (\u201cIn light of the coronavirus \u2026\u201d) implies a queasy connection between the virus and the beer that people might not have considered until they were polled.\nOn the other hand, the final three questions \u2015 including the one responsible for that startling 38% statistic \u2015 don\u2019t explicitly mention coronavirus as a motivation at all. In other words, drinkers who said they wouldn\u2019t buy Corona might simply have meant that they prefer to order a different brand of beer.\nThe much less eye-catching but entirely more plausible statistic is that, even \u201cin light of the coronavirus,\u201d just 4% of Americans who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d say they \u201cplan to stop\u201d drinking it. Even here, the framing of the question is sloppy: If respondents \u201cplan to stop,\u201d doesn\u2019t that imply they haven\u2019t given it up yet?\nA different poll by YouGov reported that \u201cCorona\u2019s Buzz score \u2014 a net score based on whether US adults have heard anything negative or positive about the brand\u201d had decreased sharply since the beginning of January 2020, and that \u201cpurchase intent for the brand is at the lowest it\u2019s been in two years.\u201d But again, the poll didn\u2019t document any actual decrease in Corona sales due to consumer confusion over a supposed link between the beer and the virus.\nIn fact, CNN reported that Constellation Brands, Corona\u2019s producer, had reported an uptick in sales of the Corona Extra brand in the U.S.:\nConstellation Brands (STZ), which brews several variations of the popular lager, said in a statement that its customers \u201cunderstand there is no link between the virus and our business.\u201d\n\u201cSales of Corona remain very strong and we appreciate the continued support from our fans,\u201d Constellation Brands spokesperson Stephanie McGuane told CNN Business. \u201cOur advertising with Corona is consistent with the campaign we have been running for the last 30 years and is based off strong consumer sentiment.\u201d\nConstellation said Corona Extra sales grew 5% in the United States in the four weeks that ended February 16. That\u2019s nearly double the trend of the past 52 weeks. Corona\u2019s sales are heavily dependent on the US market, unlike some of its far-more-international rivals.\nReuters similarly reported Constellation Brands as declaring that \u201call units supporting its beer business are seeing positive sales trends for the brand thus far in 2020 despite claims about the impact of the coronavirus on its business.\u201d\nNonetheless, the trope that \u201cpeople are dumb enough to believe you can get the coronavirus by drinking Corona beer\u201d caught on with the press because, as legends often do, it validated something many readers were willing to believe, according to the Atlantic:\nThe real question is why this obscure poll would, even if it had been true, be able to capture the imagination of so many people. And the answer is as obvious as it is saddening: Clearly, a lot of Americans already think that their fellow citizens are stupid. The real reason a fake finding could have spread so far so quickly is that it confirmed prejudices about the world that many have held all along.", "links": ["https://www.snopes.com/collections/new-coronavirus-collection/", "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/5wpr-survey-reveals-38-of-beer-drinking-americans-wouldnt-buy-corona-now-301012225.html", "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/about-corona-poll/607240/", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/corona-beer-coronavirus-poll_n_5e598955c5b6450a30be6b33", "https://today.yougov.com/topics/food/articles-reports/2020/02/26/first-it-was-joke-corona-beer-really-suffering-cor", "https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/02/28/business/corona-beer-marketing/index.html", "https://hamodia.com/2020/03/01/corona-beer-maker-u-s-sales-remain-strong-despite-virus-outbreak/"], "imgs": []}
