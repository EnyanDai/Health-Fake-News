Trump was responding to a reporter who asked how long the president expected to take hydroxychloroquine, a drug that Trump has been promoting as a potential treatment for COVID-19 without medical evidence for its safety or efficacy.\nHere is a transcription of the exchange between the reporter and Trump, per WhiteHouse.gov:\nQ Sir, how long do you expect take hydroxychloroquine?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think it\u2019s another day. I had a two-week regimen of hydroxychloroquine. And I\u2019ve taken it, I think, just about two weeks. I think it\u2019s another day. And I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still here. And I tested very positively in a \u2014 in another sense.\nSo, this morning \u2014\nQ Negatively?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I tested positively toward negative, right? So, no, I tested perfectly this morning, meaning \u2014 meaning I tested negative.\nQ Have you taken the antibody test yet?\nTHE PRESIDENT: But that\u2019s a way of saying it: positively toward the negative.\nQ Have you taken the antibody test yet, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I have not.\nBecause Trump did make the comment and it was reflected accurately by the tweet in question, we rate this claim \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d", "links": ["https://twitter.com/feliciasonmez/status/1263514808109989890", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-marine-one-departure-92/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/trump-doesnt-wear-coronavirus-mask-to-ford-plant.html", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/22/trump-is-not-only-leader-pushing-unproven-coronavirus-cures/"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/05/tweet-2.jpg"]}
