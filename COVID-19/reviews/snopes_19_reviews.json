One such example \u2014 supposedly originating with the medical sage known as \u201cold Chinese doctor\u201d \u2014 held that consuming a bowl of boiled garlic water would \u201cimprove and cure\u201d persons afflicted with the malady overnight:\n\nGarlic has long been claimed as possessing qualities that aid in the prevention and treatment of various illnesses, including colds and flu, but scientific evidence supporting such claims is weak or lacking.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) specifically addressed this rumor in reference to COVID-19 and noted that although \u201cgarlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties,\u201d there\u2019s no evidence that \u201ceating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus\u201d:\n\nBBC News similarly reported of this rumor that:\nIn lots of cases, these kinds of remedies aren\u2019t harmful in themselves, as long as they aren\u2019t preventing you from following evidence-based medical advice. But they have the potential to be.\nThe South China Morning Post reported a story of a woman who had to receive hospital treatment for a severely inflamed throat after consuming 1.5kg of raw garlic.\nWe know, in general, that eating fruit and vegetables and drinking water can be good for staying healthy. However, there is no evidence specific foods will help fight this particular virus.\nOn the plus side, this \u201ctreatment\u201d might help keep away others who could potentially infect you.", "links": ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6465033/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103721/", "https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/19.png", "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51735367"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/03/MemeOverlay_square.png"]}
