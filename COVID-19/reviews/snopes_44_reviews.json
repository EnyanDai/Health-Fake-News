States with rising numbers of COVID-19 cases were scrambling to supply hospitals with enough ventilators to meet expected need.\nThe Facebook meme claimed that Democrats were purposely trying to make the pandemic worse by stashing ventilators in a warehouse instead of distributing them to hospitals, where they were needed.\nThe posts, in part, echoed a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump that suggested New York wasn\u2019t acting quickly enough to distribute ventilators delivered by the federal government:\n\nHowever, both the above-displayed Facebook meme and Trump\u2019s tweet contained misleading information.\nVentilators were not \u201cfound\u201d in a New York warehouse. Officials were storing them there so they can be sent out to hospitals as the need arose. The photograph used in the Facebook meme was taken by Gothamist photographer Scott Lynch on March 24, 2020. According to Lynch\u2019s caption, it depicts 400 ventilators that were \u201cset to be transported to hospitals.\u201d Officials in New York had requested 30,000 ventilators for when cases were expected to peak in subsequent weeks. As of March 24, officials reported only having a fraction of that number.\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo responded to Trump\u2019s tweet during a March 27 interview on CNN by calling it \u201cincorrect and grossly uninformed.\u201d Cuomo said that while state officials had projected they would imminently need 30,000 at the peak of escalating hospitalizations, those ventilators were not needed yet. Cuomo stated:\n\u201cThat is incorrect and grossly uninformed. The point is, we have ventilators in a stockpile, and we didn\u2019t send them to the hospitals yet. Of course we didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the whole point. The hospitals don\u2019t need them yet. The hospitals aren\u2019t at their apex. The hospitals have enough ventilators today. But the numbers (of hospitalizations from COVID-19) are going up. We\u2019re planning for an apex, a high point in about 21 days. That\u2019s when we need the 30,000 ventilators, not today. Right now we\u2019re putting them in a stockpile. So the point is, well they\u2019re in a stockpile, you must not need them. It\u2019s just ignorant. Of course you don\u2019t need them today. You need them when you hit the apex, which is 30,000 (patients needing ventilators). We\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\nBecause meme contains a false description of the photograph of ventilators about to be sent to hospitals in New York, and because it states, contrary to all evidence, that Democrats were \u201ctrying to extend the virus instead of stopping it,\u201d we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "links": ["https://archive.is/ZvQAs", "https://gothamist.com/news/coronavirus-updates-new-york-state-attack-rate-virus-italy", "https://gothamist.com/news/coronavirus-updates-new-york-state-attack-rate-virus-italy", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXDimuOshS8", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXDimuOshS8"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/03/tweet.jpg"]}
