While the events in this game were obviously fiction, some social media users pointed to a few strange coincidences in January 2020 as China and other countries responded to the real-world spread of a new coronavirus.\u00a0\nSocial media posts claimed that the logo of a biotech lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the January 2020 outbreak, was eerily similar to the logo of the Umbrella Corporation. Furthermore, these posts noted how \u201ccorona\u201d was an anagram for \u201cracoon,\u201d the city at the center of \u201cResident Evil.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThis eerie coincidence wasn\u2019t too eerie on second glance.\u00a0\nFor starters, the picture on the left did not show the logo for a biotech company in Wuhan. As one can infer from its name (which can be fully seen on an uncropped version of this image), Shang Hai Ruilan Bao Hu San Biotech Limited is located in Shanghai, not Wuhan. These two Chinese cities are approximately 500 miles away from one another.\u00a0\nThe company\u2019s website (ruiblue.com) shows that the blue-and-white, umbrella-like logo is real, and that the company is located in Shanghai, China.\nThe claim that \u201cCorona\u201d is an anagram for \u201cRaccoon\u201d is also a curious one. As you\u2019ll notice by re-reading the previous sentence, \u201cCorona\u201d has a single \u201cC\u201d while \u201cRaccoon\u201d has two \u201cc\u2019s.\u201d While Merriam-Webster noted that \u201cRacoon\u201d is a valid, albeit less common, spelling for this dumpster-diving mammal, the city in the \u201cResident Evil\u201d games is spelled \u201cRaccoon City.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn short, the logo for the Umbrella Corporation is similar to the logo of a biotech company in China. However, this company, which no longer appears to be in operation, was not located in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, but in Shanghai, a city about 500 miles to the east.", "links": ["https://twitter.com/Undoomed/status/1221545217641402370", "https://kotaku.com/chinese-resident-evil-fans-think-this-biotech-companys-1835609001", "http://archive.is/a2gZH", "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racoon"], "imgs": ["https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/01/UndoomedUmbrellaTweet.png", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/01/raccoon-city.jpg"]}
