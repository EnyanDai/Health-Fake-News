Many were without masks.\n\n\u201cWe all live on it, so it has been torture looking at it and not being able to be out here,\u201d one beachgoer told CNN.\n\nJacksonville opened beaches from 6-11 a.m. and 5-8 p.m. daily, with some restrictions including no sunbathing or lounging in chairs or on blankets.\n\n\u201cThis can be the beginning of the pathway back to normal life,\u201d Mayor Lenny Curry reportedly said.\n\nCurry made the call after Gov. Ron DeSantis gave the green light for some municipalities to begin reopening beaches.\n\n\n\nPolice were seen warning people who didn\u2019t adhere to the no-sunbathing rule, according to photos posted to social media, while a flyover sign warned people: \u201cDo your part. Stay 6 feet apart. Help keep beaches open.\u201d\n\nFlorida announced 1,400 new cases Friday, the highest 24-hour toll since the pandemic began.", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/200418-jacksonville-florida-beach.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/knewz_300x250.png"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/200418-jacksonville-florida-beach.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["April"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2020/04/18/hundreds-flood-florida-beach-as-florida-reopens-some-parks/", "title": "Jacksonville beach packed as Florida coronavirus cases hit record", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
