And, even if the virus\u2019 spread does slow as temperatures rise, that doesn\u2019t mean it will be gone for good.\n\nNew studies suggest heat may slow coronavirus\n\nSome early research, which has yet to be peer reviewed, says that higher temperatures and humidity are correlated with a lower rate of COVID-19\u2019s spread.\n\nAn analysis by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology posted online on Mar. 19, found that the transmission of coronavirus had most frequently occurred in regions with colder annual average temperatures, between about 37\u00b0 and 63\u00b0 F. The total number of cases in countries with an average temperature above about 64\u00b0 F is less than 6%, according to the study.\n\nTwo other recently published studies draw similar conclusions. One study published in March by Chinese researchers found that before the Chinese government began imposing lockdowns in late January, cities that were warmer and more humid reported a slower rate of infection.\n\nAnother, published in mid-March by researchers from Spain and Finland, found that 95% of infections globally have so far occurred at temperatures between about 28\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 F, and in dry climates.\n\nHowever, the spread of coronavirus has also shown that hot and humid weather will not stop coronavirus infections entirely. Malaysia has confirmed more than 1,500 cases of the virus; more than 500 people are infected in Indonesia; and in Singapore, where the average temperature is around 80\u00b0F year-round, more than 500 cases of the virus have been confirmed, despite rigorous detection methods and strict quarantine rules.\n\nKeep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here.\n\nWhy cold and flu decrease in the summer\n\nThere\u2019s precedent for the idea that the COVID-19 outbreak will collapse with the onset of summer.\n\nThe common cold is most prevalent in the winter and spring, and influenza is most common during the fall and winter in the U.S., with flu activity peaking between December and February, according to the CDC.\n\nIt appears that COVID-19 is transmitted in the same fashion as the flu and common cold: by close contact with infected people and from respiratory droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs.\n\nThere\u2019s a variety of reasons that influenza and cold infections plummet in the summer, but a major one is that that warm, humid weather can make it harder for respiratory droplets to spread viruses.\n\n\u201cThe droplets that carry viruses do not stay suspended in humid air as long, and the warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation,\u201d says Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nHuman activity also changes in summer months, says Thomas Bollyky, the director of the Global Health Program at the Washington D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations. People spend less time indoors\u2014where they tend to be in closer contact with each other, making it easier for the virus to spread\u2014in the summer.\n\n\u2018Premature\u2019 to assume heat will stop COVID-19\n\nBut health experts aren\u2019t so sure that COVID-19, which has infected more than 83,000 people since officials first discovered the disease in December, can be stopped by the onset of summer.\n\nDr. Nancy Messionnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned against assuming the number of cases will slow as the weather warms. \u201cI think it\u2019s premature to assume that,\u201d she said during a call with reporters on Feb. 12. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been through even a single year with this pathogen.\u201d\n\nOther health experts that TIME spoke to agree that it\u2019s too early to say if warmer weather will impact the virus\u2019s spread. McGraw, of Penn State University, says there will likely be many factors that determine when and how the outbreak ends. \u201cRate of virus spread, effectiveness of infection control practices, weather and human immunity will likely all play a role in determining its future,\u201d she says.\n\nAdditionally, because COVID-19 is so new, \u201cthere is no natural immunity in the population and thus all bets are off,\u201d says John Nicholls of the University of Hong Kong.\n\nLooking at two other deadly members of the coronavirus family, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), could, Bollyky says, help us understand how COVID-19 may act in the summer heat. \u201cPast coronavirus outbreaks, SARS and MERS, haven\u2019t really exhibited clear evidence of being seasonal,\u201d Bollyky says.\u201dThe SARS outbreak did end in July, but it is not clear that weather. MERS does not show any sign of being seasonal.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t summer everywhere at once\n\nThough the largest clusters of the coronavirus are in locations above the equator\u2014mainland China, South Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran\u2014the virus has now spread to all continents except Antarctica. This includes countries like Brazil and Australia in the southern hemisphere.\n\nExperts caution that even if the seasonal change in the northern hemisphere brings a reprieve in the number of cases, it may mean that other places become more susceptible to its spread.\n\n\u201cThe southern hemisphere will begin their winter season within the next few months, potentially leading to a global reversal in transmission hotspots,\u201d says Melissa Nolan, a professor of epidemiology at the University of South Carolina\u2019s Arnold School of Public Health.\n\nEven if COVID-19 wanes in summer, it might come back\n\nAnd experts warn that even if COVID-19 becomes less active in the summer, it could return if public health officials do not gain control of the outbreak first.\n\n\u201cIf we continue to see sustained transmission in multiple countries, it will be very difficult to eradicate the virus,\u201d says Charles Chiu, a professor of laboratory medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThere is a risk that it may end up becoming a seasonal virus without global concerted public health interventions to prevent spread.\u201d\n\nHe points to the 2009 outbreak of the H1N1 virus, otherwise known as swine flu, which began in April of that year. He says that as it adapted to the human population, it adopted a seasonal pattern, with most infections now occurring during the winter months.\n\nOthers agree that officials must not be complacent as the summer months approach.\n\n\u201cPolicymakers and health officials should not rely on warmer temperatures to save us from COVID-19,\u201d Bollyky, of the Council on Foreign Relations, says. \u201cThe only things that can do that are public health preparedness and level-headed policies to reduce the number of people infected, protect healthcare workers, and improve the diagnosis and treatment of those who do get ill.\u201d\n\nPlease send any tips, leads, and stories to virus@time.com.\n\nThe Coronavirus Brief.
