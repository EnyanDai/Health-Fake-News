Photo : Getty Images\n\nA 17-year-old boy in Los Angeles County who became the first teen believed to have died from complications with covid-19 in the U.S. was denied treatment at an urgent care clinic because he didn\u2019t have health insurance, according to R. Rex Parris, the mayor of Lancaster, California. Roughly 27.5 million Americans\u20148.5 percent of the population\u2014don\u2019t have health insurance based on the latest government figures.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have insurance, so they did not treat him,\u201d Parris said in a video posted to YouTube. The staff at the urgent care facility told the teen to try the emergency room at Antelope Valley (AV) Hospital, a public hospital in the area, according to the mayor.\n\n\u201cEn route to AV Hospital, he went into cardiac arrest, when he got to AV hospital they were able to revive him and keep him alive for about six hours,\u201d Parris said. \u201cBut by the time he got there, it was too late.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name of the urgent care clinic that refused to treat the teen has not been released. Mayor Parris explained in his YouTube video that the 17-year-old is believed to have had no underlying conditions that may have contributed to his death.\n\n\u201cHe had been sick for a few days, he had no previous health conditions. On the Friday before he died, he was healthy, he was socializing with his friends,\u201d the mayor explained.\n\nLos Angeles County currently has 1,216 covid-19 cases and 21 deaths, according to the L.A. County Public Health Department\u2019s website. The U.S. as a whole has identified at least 85,991 covid-19 cases and 1,296 deaths as of Friday morning, according to the Johns Hopkins online coronavirus tracker. The U.S. became the country with the highest number of confirmed cases of the virus in the world yesterday, surpassing China and Italy.\n\nThe Lancaster teen tested positive for covid-19, but the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is reportedly evaluating the case to see if there\u2019s another explanation for his death. The initial cause of death was explained on Tuesday as septic shock from complications with covid-19. The teen\u2019s father has tested positive for covid-19 as well. The teen\u2019s death has been removed from the official U.S. death toll, according to Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer, who gave a press conference on March 25.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCountries with authoritarian leaders like China, Iran, and Russia have adopted a strategy of denying that some people have actually died from covid-19, even after they test positive for the disease. In Russia, for example a 79-year-old woman in Moscow recently died of the new coronavirus, but the Russian government said that while she may have tested positive, she actually died of pneumonia. Moscow saw a 37 percent surge of \u201cpneumonia\u201d cases in January over the previous year, according to ABC News.\n\nThere have also been allegations from health care workers in the U.S. that some covid-19 deaths aren\u2019t being properly counted, even as hospitals become overwhelmed with patients, sometimes waiting hours to get tested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know. The numbers are grossly underreported. I know for a fact that we\u2019ve had three deaths in one county where only one is listed on the website,\u201d one unnamed nurse in California told BuzzFeed News this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople are already dying in New York emergency rooms waiting for ICU beds, according to the New York Times. President Donald Trump has denied that there\u2019s a ventilator shortage, a dangerous lie. Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News last night that he doesn\u2019t like hearing \u201ccomplaints\u201d from governors and that states don\u2019t actually need more ventilators, contradicting overwhelming evidence that hospitals across the U.S. will need thousands more ventilators in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI think that a lot of things are being said that are more [than needed],\u201d Trump said of the medical equipment being asked for by governors. \u201cI don\u2019t think certain things will materialize. A lot of equipment\u2019s being asked for that I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll need.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles County is preparing for an influx of patients like they\u2019re seeing in other U.S. hotspots like New York, Washington, and Louisiana. The Los Angeles Convention Center is currently being converted into a quarantine center according to local CBS TV affiliate KCAL-9. And the city of Lancaster is setting up makeshift triage centers, as evidenced by the number of cots in Mayor Parris\u2019s own video on YouTube.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna get through this, and we\u2019re going to be a much stronger community when we do get through this. We\u2019re going to see things in each other we never dreamed possible. It\u2019s not going to be terrible when it\u2019s over, but we have a ways to go,\u201d Parris said, urging people to take the covid-19 pandemic seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis next few months, we have to be together. We have to be strong. And most importantly, stay home.\u201d", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/szvvjkbigg4rwomjytym.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/szvvjkbigg4rwomjytym.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://gizmodo.com/teen-who-died-of-covid-19-was-denied-treatment-because-1842520539", "title": "Teen Who Died of Covid-19 Was Denied Treatment Because He Didn't Have Health Insurance", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "Sc6OGUq5heWyOLFpCb_2K6mX7vFrWKGANts4QDUmgOY", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/fdj3buryz5nuzyf2k620.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/fdj3buryz5nuzyf2k620.png", "keywords": "covid-19, coronavirus, teens, cdc, r. rex parris, los angeles, california, health insurance, new york, louisiana, Gizmodo", "news_keywords": "covid-19, coronavirus, teens, cdc, r. rex parris, los angeles, california, health insurance, new york, louisiana, Gizmodo", "twitter": {"url": "https://gizmodo.com/teen-who-died-of-covid-19-was-denied-treatment-because-1842520539", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "gizmodo", "title": "Teen Who Died of Covid-19 Was Denied Treatment Because He Didn't Have Health Insurance", "description": "A 17-year-old boy in Los Angeles County who became the first teen believed to have died from complications with covid-19 in the U.S. was denied treatment at an urgent care clinic because he didn\u2019t have health insurance, according to R.
