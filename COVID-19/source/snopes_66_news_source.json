Could one imagine walking into a bar and saying \"Hey, can I have a Corona?\" or \"Pass me A Corona,\" said Ronn Torossian, Founder and CEO of 5WPR. \"While the brand has claimed that consumers understand there's no linkage between the virus and the beer company, this is a disaster for the Corona brand. After all, what brand wants to be linked to a virus which is killing people worldwide?\"\n\nYouGov's buzz score reported that Corona beer's buzz score \u2014 a net score based on whether U.S. adults have heard anything negative or positive about the brand \u2014 decreased among those who have an opinion of the brand, from a high score of 75 at the beginning of January to 51 as of late February, 2020.\n\nAbout 5W Public Relations\n\n5W Public Relations is a full-service PR agency in NYC known for cutting-edge programs that engage with businesses, issues and ideas.
