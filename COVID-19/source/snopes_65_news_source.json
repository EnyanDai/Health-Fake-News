The poll, conducted by 5W Public Relations, saw coverage in multiple media outlets.\n\nMany Twitter users seemed delighted for an excuse to poke fun at the rest of the country for jumping to such a dubious presumption (the beer, of course, is in no way related to the virus). But the poll and the reaction to it present their own lessons in drawing tenuous conclusions.\n\n\u201cClearly, a lot of Americans already think that their fellow citizens are stupid,\u201d Yascha Mounk wrote at The Atlantic. \u201cThe real reason a fake finding could have spread so far so quickly is that it confirmed prejudices about the world that many have held all along.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true that Corona beer has drawn a wave of negative associations based on the unfortunate coincidence of its name in a way that could plausibly shift consumer behavior. But what we know about the survey driving the story falls far short of backing up the more far-reaching claims.\n\nThe press release touting the poll offers little detail on what, exactly, people were asked, and 5W Public Relations has not been immediately forthcoming in answering additional questions. The firm provided a list of the questions it asked to Mounk and to the conservative site The Dispatch but refused to provide exact results for each question. 5WPR did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests to provide a list of the survey\u2019s questions, answer choices and results.\n\n\n\nHere are the questions that were asked, according to The Dispatch\u2019s Declan Garvey, combined with the results 5WPR chose to include in its press release:\n\nAre you a beer drinker?\n\nAre you a Corona drinker?\n\nIs Corona related to the coronavirus? (16% of beer-drinkers were \u201cconfused\u201d about this.)\n\nIn light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona? (4% who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d said they planned to stop.)\n\nWould you buy Corona in a store?\n\nWould you order a Corona in a restaurant/bar/public venue? (14% who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d said they would not.)\n\nWould you buy Corona under any circumstances now? (38% of \u201cbeer-drinking Americans\u201d said they would not.)\n\nThere are any number of ways a careful market researcher might attempt to tease out how, if at all, coronavirus has affected perceptions of the beer. This isn\u2019t one of them. Instead, these questions manage to fail simultaneously in two different directions. On one hand, some of the phrasing (\u201cIn light of the coronavirus...\u201d) implies a queasy connection between the virus and the beer that people might not have considered until they were polled.\n\nOn the other hand, the final three questions \u2015 including the one responsible for that startling 38% statistic \u2015 don\u2019t explicitly mention coronavirus as a motivation at all. In other words, drinkers who said they wouldn\u2019t buy Corona might simply have meant that they prefer to order a different brand of beer.\n\nThe much less eye-catching but entirely more plausible statistic is that, even \u201cin light of the coronavirus,\u201d just 4% of Americans who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d say they \u201cplan to stop\u201d drinking it. Even here, the framing of the question is sloppy: If respondents \u201cplan to stop,\u201d doesn\u2019t that imply they haven\u2019t given it up yet?\n\nBeyond the lack of clarity on the questionnaire, the press release is also somewhat vague about how the poll was conducted. According to 5WPR, it was run \u201cvia phone\u201d and surveyed \u201c737 American beer drinkers over the age of 21 on February 25 & 26, 2020.\u201d Nothing about that description raises immediate red flags, and it\u2019s a generally acceptable sample size for a national survey. But it falls short of answering a number of basic methodological questions, including whether the poll used live interviewers or robocalls, how it identified respondents and how it was weighted. Because of that lack of detail, we also don\u2019t know what share of its sample \u201cusually\u201d drinks Corona and whether that subgroup is large enough to examine on its own.\n\nThere is some additional data on Corona beer beyond the 5WPR release. The polling firm YouGov, which tracks consumer sentiment on a variety of brands, shows Corona experiencing a pretty clear uptick in negative \u201cbuzz,\u201d meaning that people who\u2019ve heard of the brand are more likely to say they\u2019ve heard something bad about it recently. That\u2019s not surprising, especially considering a previous (and similarly overhyped) wave of stories about a small uptick in the number of people searching for the term \u201ccorona beer virus\u201d on Google. Stories based on the latest survey are likely to lend themselves to another wave of negative buzz.\n\nYouGov YouGov BrandIndex Poll On Corona Beer\n\nYouGov\u2019s polling also finds that \u201cpurchase intent,\u201d which they define as the share of people who say Corona is the brand of beer they\u2019re most likely to buy, has fallen to its lowest point in two years. But, as YouGov notes, Corona\u2019s product \u201cis closely associated with beach holidays [and] does see substantial seasonal fluctuation.\u201d Looking at the chart suggests that the brand\u2019s recent drop on this metric is only slightly more dramatic than the previous ups and downs it\u2019s seen in years past. (A spokesperson for brewer Constellation Brands told CNN that Corona sales \u201cremain very strong.\u201d)\n\n\n\nYouGov YouGov BrandIndex Poll On Corona Beer\n\nIn interpreting all this data, it\u2019s also worth asking a few more questions about what it would actually mean if someone said they\u2019d stopped drinking Corona because of coronavirus. It might mean that a person mistakenly believes that the beer would made them sick. But it could also encompass other rationales \u2015 for instance, \u201cthe name reminds me of something unpleasant I\u2019d rather not think about,\u201d or \u201cordering one at the bar feels like asking to be the setup for a joke.\u201d\n\nIf the 38% statistic doesn\u2019t tell us much about Americans\u2019 reaction to a pandemic, it does present a pretty good case study in the way misinformation can spread. And it offers one easy remedy to combat it: News outlets shouldn\u2019t write about polls unless they know exactly what questions were asked, and readers should treat any stories that don\u2019t provide that information with an appropriate grain of salt.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e598c5b230000590d39c77a.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e598c5a230000c00bdddc25.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d532dc22200001a00f53c4b.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20200109/Privacy_Rights_icon.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e5989a9230000c00bdddc24.jpeg?cache=ly81o2j05l&ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e5989a9230000c00bdddc24.jpeg?cache=ly81o2j05l&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e5989a9230000c00bdddc24.jpeg?cache=ly81o2j05l&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Polling Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/corona-beer-coronavirus-poll_n_5e598955c5b6450a30be6b33", "title": "No, 38% Of Americans Probably Didn't Stop Drinking Corona Because Of Coronavirus", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "When polling gets filtered through beer goggles.", "keywords": "Polling,Coronavirus,Corona beer", "og": {"title": "No, 38% Of Americans Probably Didn't Stop Drinking Corona Beer Because Of Coronavirus", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e5989a9230000c00bdddc24.jpeg?cache=ly81o2j05l&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e5989a9230000c00bdddc24.jpeg?cache=ly81o2j05l&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/corona-beer-coronavirus-poll_n_5e598955c5b6450a30be6b33", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "When polling gets filtered through beer goggles."}, "article": {"tag": "Polling,Coronavirus,Corona beer", "section": "Politics", "published_time": "2020-02-28 19:21:19 -0500", "modified_time": "2020-02-28 19:21:19 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "title": "No, 38% Of Americans Probably Didn't Stop Drinking Corona Beer Because Of Coronavirus", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e5989a9230000c00bdddc24.jpeg?cache=ly81o2j05l&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "When polling gets filtered through beer goggles.", "creator": "aedwardslevy"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5e598955c5b6450a30be6b33", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "politics"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1582935679.0, "source": "https://www.huffpost.com", "summary": ""}
