No other animals at the zoo are showing symptoms.\n\n\"Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers,\" the zoo said.\n\n\"It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries.\"\n\nRead More", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200423171947-typsonemployee-lead-tuchman-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200408123124-unemployment-us-0401-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200423161958-man-dies-covid-19-100-years-after-twin-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200405171251-bronx-zoo-tiger-coronavirus-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200306171508-coronavirus-vaccine-lab-germany-pleitgen-pkg-00000000-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200424114555-sidner-nursing-home-pkg-newday-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200405171251-bronx-zoo-tiger-coronavirus-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200423201432-money-on-walls-resturant-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200228111204-01-coronavirus-treatment-testing-0205-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200424112012-bill-weir-son-being-born-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200423103610-wuhan-china-second-wave-coronavirus-fears-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200422171814-robert-redfield-cdc-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200405171251-bronx-zoo-tiger-coronavirus-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200423165043-nurses-protesters-face-off-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200319110921-01-bats-coronavirus-study-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200423195253-spit-droplets-traveling-when-talking-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200424194641-tim-timmons-christopher-escobar-georgia-small-business-owners-ebof-screengrab-04242020-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200424090359-atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200424120542-ga-salon-owner-large-169.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200405171251-bronx-zoo-tiger-coronavirus-super-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alaa Elassar"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/05/us/tiger-coronavirus-new-york-trnd/index.html", "title": "A tiger at the Bronx Zoo tests positive for coronavirus", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "section": "us", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"pubdate": "2020-04-05T21:47:11Z", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/05/us/tiger-coronavirus-new-york-trnd/index.html", "title": "A tiger at the Bronx Zoo tests positive for coronavirus", "description": "A tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York has become the first tiger to test positive for the coronavirus.", "site_name": "CNN", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200405171251-bronx-zoo-tiger-coronavirus-super-tease.jpg", "width": 1100, "height": 619}}, "pubdate": "2020-04-05T21:47:11Z", "lastmod": "2020-04-06T07:29:20Z", "author": "Alaa Elassar, CNN", "twitter": {"title": "A tiger at the Bronx Zoo tests positive for coronavirus", "description": "A tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York has become the first tiger to test positive for the coronavirus.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200405171251-bronx-zoo-tiger-coronavirus-super-tease.jpg"}, "description": "A tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York has become the first tiger to test positive for the coronavirus.", "keywords": "us, A tiger at the Bronx Zoo tests positive for coronavirus - CNN", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200405171251-bronx-zoo-tiger-coronavirus-super-tease.jpg", "vr": {"canonical": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/05/us/tiger-coronavirus-new-york-trnd/index.html"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content-tier": "free"}, "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "template-top": "us,news,art-vid-vls-col,col-coronavirus-"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1586059200.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
